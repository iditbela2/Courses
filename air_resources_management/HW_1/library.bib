abstract = {Measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are essential for understanding and monitoring spatially heterogeneous environments with complex and highly variable emission sources, such as in urban areas. However, the costs and complexity of conventional air quality measurement methods means that measurement networks are generally extremely sparse. In this paper we show that miniature, low-cost electrochemical gas sensors, traditionally used for sensing at parts-per-million (ppm) mixing ratios can, when suitably configured and operated, be used for parts-per-billion (ppb) level studies for gases relevant to urban air quality. Sensor nodes, in this case consisting of multiple individual electrochemical sensors, can be low-cost and highly portable, thus allowing the deployment of scalable high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations.In this paper we provide evidence for the performance of electrochemical sensors at the parts-per-billion level, and then outline results obtained from deployments of networks of sensor nodes in both an autonomous, high-density, static network in the wider Cambridge (UK) area, and as mobile networks for quantification of personal exposure. Examples are presented of measurements obtained with both highly portable devices held by pedestrians and cyclists, and static devices attached to street furniture. The widely varying mixing ratios reported by this study confirm that the urban environment cannot be fully characterised using sparse, static networks, and that measurement networks with higher resolution (both spatially and temporally) are required to quantify air quality at the scales which are present in the urban environment. We conclude that the instruments described here, and the low-cost/high-density measurement philosophy which underpins it, have the potential to provide a far more complete assessment of the high-granularity air quality structure generally observed in the urban environment, and could ultimately be used for quantification of human exposure as well as for monitoring and legislative purposes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {While intense scientific efforts have focused on radar precipitation estimation in temperate climatic regimes, relatively few studies have examined dry climatic regions. This paper examines rain depth estimation for a 19 day rainfall period in Israel, where the gauge spatial distribution is particularly nonhomogeneous. This fact exacerbates the main drawback of rain gauge observations, which is undersampling. Meteorological ground-based radar (GR) can supplement the desired information on precipitation distribution. However, especially in a complex orographic region, radar scientists are faced with beam broadening with distance, nonhomogeneous beam filling, and partial-beam occultation, together with changes in the vertical reflectivity profile. This paper presents an improvement of GR precipitation estimates thanks to a range adjustment based on spaceborne meteorological radar. In the past, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite radar was used for checking the GR mean field bias around the world. To our knowledge, however, it is the first time that GR-derived cumulative rainfall amounts show a better agreement with gauges, thanks to the mean field bias and range-dependent compensation derived using the well-calibrated Ku band TRMM radar as a reference. The average bias improves from +1.0 dB to -0.3 dB; more interesting and difficult to obtain is a reduction of the dispersion of the error. Using TRMM-based range compensation, the scatter decreases from 2.21 dB to 1.93 dB. We conclude that it is well worth trying to compensate for the GR range degradation.},

abstract = {The monitoring of the world's climate using conventional means is well established, incorporating numerous historical data sets to ensure a long-term record. Parameters such as temperature have been quite accurately recorded over the last 200 years or so, but other parameters such as rainfall are less well recorded. This paper introduces satellite rainfall climatology and why it is important, not only from the longer term study of rainfall, but also for the future monitoring and estimation of rainfall. A summary of the range of satellites and their instruments is reviewed to provide a background to the techniques. These are discussed and their relative merits explored. Finally, examples of the techniques are shown, illustrating the applications to which the satellite-derived data sets may be put. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Up-to-date information on urban air pollution is of great importance for environmental protection agencies to assess air quality and provide advice to the general public in a timely manner. In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 50 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than two years using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100 m × 100 m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with sub-weekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26{\%} reduction in the root-mean-square error-a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models-of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment.},

abstract = {KNOWLEDGE of the kinematic structure of storms is important for understanding the internal physical processes. Radar has long provided information on the three-dimensional structure of storms from measurements of the radar reflectivity factor alone. Early users of radar gave total storm movement only, whereas later radar data were used to reveal internal motions based on information related to cloud physics such as the three-dimensional morphology of the storm volume. Such approaches have continued by using the increasingly finer scale details provided by more modern radar systems. Both Barge and Bergwall and Browning and Foote have used fine scale reflectivity structure to determine airflow in hailstorms. Doppler radar added a new dimension to our capabilities through its ability to measure directly the radial component of motion of an ensemble of hydrometeor particles. Two or three Doppler radars collecting data in conjunction, the equation of mass continuity, and an empirical radar reflectivity�terminal velocity relationship have enabled the estimation of the full three-dimensional airflow fields in parts of storms. Because of the inherent advantage of Doppler radar in motion detection, little effort has been directed toward developing objective schemes of determining internal storm motions with conventional meteorological radars. Pattern recognition schemes using correlation coefficient techniques, Fourier analysis, and gaussian curve fitting have been used with radar and satellite data, but primarily for detecting overall storm motions, echo merging and echo splitting. Here we describe an objective use of radar reflectivity factor data from a single conventional weather radar to give information related to the three-dimensional motions within a storm.},

abstract = {The rate at which limestone dissolves determines the resistance of buildings and monuments to weathering, the efficiency of carbon capture in deep geological reservoirs, and the processes by which soils, rocks, and landscapes form and evolve. However, the normalized rates of mineral dissolution measured in laboratory experiments are often found to be far greater than those measured in field settings. Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to demonstrate experimentally that the rate of calcite dissolution within micron-size pores at the surface of a limestone sample is much lower than the rate of dissolution in the surrounding calcite surface. In addition, we use numerical simulations to show that this difference cannot be explained using a simple diffusion-surface reaction model. We suggest that the observed heterogeneous reaction rates could instead be due to the elevated density of reactive high curvature features on the polished surface surrounding the pore. These high curvature features can strongly affect local interfacial free energy, making such surfaces more prone to dissolution. As a result, polished surfaces should be more reactive than pore surfaces that have effectively been smoothed during prolonged contact with natural fluids. As rate experiments routinely use polished and powdered samples, the results may help to explain the widely reported discrepancy between lab and field-based dissolution rates. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Thunderstorms are often the cause of severe and disastrous flash floods. Lightning activity within these storms can be detected and monitored continuously from thousands of kilometers away and can therefore be very useful in improving forecasts and now-casts of severe thunderstorms. An improvement in the now-casting of such storms can assist in reducing damages and saving lives. Using the ZEUS ground-based VLF lightning detection network and the Warning Decision Support System-Integrated Information (WDSS-II) software, we performed now-casting simulations using 1. year of lightning data over the Mediterranean area. Thousands of thunderstorms were observed and now-cast 30, 60, 90 and 120. min ahead. Statistical analysis was then done by calculating the hit, miss and false-alarm rates, as well as the POD, FAR and CSI scores in order to determine the success of the now-casting. The results show that the algorithm is overall successful in now-casting the location of the lightning clusters, especially when applied to strong and consistent lightning events (it is these events which also have the strongest connection to flash floods). The probability of detection (POD) values range between 0.46 for 30. minute now-casts and 0.25 for 120. minute now-casts. The critical success index (CSI) values are quite similar, but slightly lower. The now-casting has a low false-alarm rate, 0.03 for 30. minute now-casts, which is also beneficial for operational use. This method has been implemented for the use in real-time now-casting and is used in the EU FLASH project to seek and track areas of thunderstorm risk according to lightning intensity. The experimental now-casts appear on the project website (www.flashproject.org/). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The rain gauge network associated with the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in southeastern Arizona provides a unique opportunity for direct comparisons of in situ measurements and satellite-based instantaneous rain rate estimates like those from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR). The WGEW network is the densest rain gauge network in the PR coverage area for watersheds greater than 10 km2. It consists of 88 weighing rain gauges within a 149-km2 area. On average, approximately 10 gauges can be found in each PR field of view ({\~{}}5-km diameter). All gauges are very well synchronized with 1-min reporting intervals. This allows generating very-high-temporal-resolution rain rate fields and obtaining accurate estimates of the area-average rain rate for the entire watershed and for a single PR field of view. In this study, instantaneous rain rate fields from the PR and the spatially interpolated gauge measurements (on a 100 m × 100 m grid, updated every 1 min) are compared for all TRMM overpasses in which the PR recorded rain within the WGEW boundaries (25 overpasses during 1999-2010). The results indicate very good agreement between the fields with low bias values (10{\%}) and high correlation coefficients, especially for the near-nadir cases ({\textgreater}0.9). The correlation is high at overpass time but the peak occurs several minutes after the overpass, which can be explained by the fact that it takes several minutes for the raindrops to reach the gauge from the time they are observed by the PR. The correlation improves with the new version of the TRMM algorithm (V7). The study includes assessment of the accuracy of the reference products.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The interannual variations and the spatial distribution of rainfall in the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel are analysed with respect to variations in the occurrence of the typical synoptic systems of the Eastern Mediterranean. The synoptic analysis is based on a daily, semi-objective synoptic classification (Alpert et al., 2004a). The study covers the months November March, in which 90{\%} of the annual rainfall is obtained, mostly resulting from Cyprus lows. The interannual variations of the rainfall are well explained by the synoptic types, and the occurrences of Cyprus lows are highly correlated with the rainfall. It was found that the daily and seasonal rainfall are highly dependent on the depth of the cyclone. Moreover, deep lows are more effective for the mountainous regions, due both to the enhanced orographic effect and to the fact that stronger winds, associated with deep lows, are more efficient in transporting rain-producing clouds from the Mediterranean Sea inland. The location of the cyclone determines the spatial distribution of the rain it produces over Israel. The cyclones located east of Cyprus were found productive mainly for the southern parts of the study region, while those located to the west and north of Israel were found productive for the north of the country. The high sensitivity of the rainfall to the location of the surface cyclones emphasizes the major role that lower level moisture transport plays in rain formation.

abstract = {We extend the method developed by Woods and Sivapalan (1999) to provide a more general analytical framework for assessing the dependence of the catchment flood response on the space-time interactions between rainfall, runoff generation and routing mechanisms. The analytical framework focuses on three characteristics of the flood hydrograph: the catchment rainfall excess rate, and the first and second temporal moments of the flood response. These characteristics are described by analytical relations, which are derived with a limited number of assumptions concerning the catchment response that comply well with many modelling approaches. The paper illustrates the development of the analytical framework and explains the conceptual meaning of the mathematical relations by taking a simple and idealised "open-book" catchment as a case study. It is shown how the components of the derived equations explicitly quantify the relative importance of processes and the space-time interactions among them during flood events. In particular, the components added to the original framework of Woods and Sivapalan (1999), which account for storm movement and hillslope routing variability in space, are demonstrated to be important and in some cases decisive in combining to bring about the flood response. The proposed analytical framework is not a predictive model but a tool to understand the magnitude of the components that contribute to runoff response, similar to the components of the St. Venant equations in fluid dynamics. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are widely used in flood risk management because they provide an easy link between the characteristics of a rainfall event and the probability of its occurrence. Weather radars provide distributed rainfall estimates with high spatial and temporal resolutions and overcome the scarce representativeness of point-based rainfall for regions characterized by large gradients in rainfall climatology. This work explores the use of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) for the identification of IDF curves over a region with steep climatic transitions (Israel) using a unique radar data record (23 yr) and combined physical and empirical adjustment of the radar data. IDF relationships were derived by fitting a generalized extreme value distribution to the annual maximum series for durations of 20 min, 1 h and 4 h. Arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean climates were explored using 14 study cases. IDF curves derived from the study rain gauges were compared to those derived from radar and from nearby rain gauges characterized by similar climatology, taking into account the uncertainty linked with the fitting technique. Radar annual maxima and IDF curves were generally overestimated but in 70{\%} of the cases (60{\%} for a 100 yr return period), they lay within the rain gauge IDF confidence intervals. Overestimation tended to increase with return period, and this effect was enhanced in arid climates. This was mainly associated with radar estimation uncertainty, even if other effects, such as rain gauge temporal resolution, cannot be neglected. Climatological classification remained meaningful for the analysis of rainfall extremes and radar was able to discern climatology from rainfall frequency analysis.},

@article{Nied2014,
abstract = {Flood generation is triggered by the interaction of the hydrological pre-conditions and the meteorological conditions at different space-time scales. This interaction results in floods of diverse characteristics, e.g. spatial flood extent and temporal flood progression. While previous studies have either linked flood occurrence to weather patterns neglecting the hydrological pre-conditions or categorised floods according to their generating mechanisms into flood types, this study combines both approaches. Exemplary for the Elbe River basin, the influence of pre-event soil moisture as an indicator of hydrological pre-conditions, on the link between weather patterns and flood occurrence is investigated. Flood favouring soil moisture and weather patterns as well as their combined influence on flood occurrence are examined. Flood types are identified and linked to soil moisture and weather patterns. The results show that the flood favouring hydro-meteorological patterns vary between seasons and can be linked to flood types. The highest flood potential for long-rain floods is associated with a weather pattern that is often identified in the presence of so called 'Vb' cyclones. Rain-on-snow and snowmelt floods are associated with westerly and north-westerly wind directions. In the analysis period, 18{\%} of weather patterns only caused flooding in case of preceding soil saturation. The presented concept is part of a paradigm shift from pure flood frequency analysis to a frequency analysis that bases itself on process understanding by describing flood occurrence and characteristics in dependence of hydro-meteorological patterns.},

This study focuses on the modeling of the systematic error component, which can be described mathematically in terms of a conditional expectation function. The authors present two different approaches: non-parametric (kernel-based) and parametric (copula-based). A large sample (more than six years) of rain gauge measurements from a dense network located in south-west England is used as an approximation of the true ground rainfall. These data are complemented with rainfall estimates by a C-band weather radar located at Wardon Hill, which is about 40 km from the catchment. The authors compare the results obtained using the parametric and non-parametric schemes for four temporal scales of hydrologic interest (5 and 15 min, hourly and three-hourly) by means of several different performance indices and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The evaluation of the effects of air pollution on public health and human-wellbeing requires reliable data. Standard air quality monitoring stations provide accurate measurements of airborne pollutant levels, but, due to their sparse distribution, they cannot capture accurately the spatial variability of air pollutant concentrations within cities. Dedicated in-depth field campaigns have dense spatial coverage of the measurements but are held for relatively short time periods. Hence, their representativeness is limited. Moreover, the oftentimes integrated measurements represent time-averaged records. Recent advances in communication and sensor technologies enable the deployment of dense grids of Wireless Distributed Environmental Sensor Networks for air quality monitoring, yet their capability to capture urban-scale spatiotemporal pollutant patterns has not been thoroughly examined to date. Here, we summarize our studies on the practicalities of using data streams from sensor nodes for air quality measurement and the required methods to tune the results to different stakeholders and applications. We summarize the results from eight cities across Europe, five sensor technologies-three stationary (with one tested also while moving) and two personal sensor platforms, and eight ambient pollutants. Overall, few sensors showed an exceptional and consistent performance, which can shed light on the fine spatiotemporal urban variability of pollutant concentrations. Stationary sensor nodes were more reliable than personal nodes. In general, the sensor measurements tend to suffer from the interference of various environmental factors and require frequent calibrations. This calls for the development of suitable field calibration procedures, and several such in situ field calibrations are presented.},

abstract = {Accurate storm identification and tracking are basic and essential parts of radar and severe weather warning operations in today's operational meteorological community. Improvements over the original WSR-88D storm series algorithm have been made with the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking algorithm (SCIT). This paper discusses the SCIT algorithm, a centroid tracking algorithm with improved methods of identifying storms (both isolated and clustered or line storms). In an analysis of 6561 storm cells, the SCIT algorithm correctly identified 68{\%} of all cells with maximum reflectivities over 40 dBZ and 96{\%} of all cells with maximum reflectivities of 50 dBZ or greater. The WSR-88D storm series algorithm performed at 24{\%} and 41{\%}, respectively, for the same dataset. With better identification performance, the potential exists for better and more accurate tracking information. The SCIT algorithm tracked greater than 90{\%} of all storm cells correctly. The algorithm techniques and results of a detailed performance evaluation are presented. This algorithm was included in the WSR-88D Build 9.0 of the Radar Products Generator software during late 1996 and early 1997. It is hoped that this paper will give new users of the algorithm sufficient background information to use the algorithm with confidence.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF},

An example for a climate change application is given by the analysis of trends in the annual frequencies of the synoptic systems. The frequencies of the mostly dry Red Sea trough (RST) systems nearly doubled since the 1960s from 50 to about 100 days per year. This explains a dominant decreasing trend of rainfall in most of the EM, along with an increase in the southern part of the EM region, when the RST is deep enough to bring tropical moisture over this area. Also, the increasing tendency towards heavier daily rainfall in spite of the general decrease in the totals may be explained by the increase in the active and stormy types of RST situations. The annual frequency of the Cyprus lows was noticed to drop slightly in 1983-98 to 26, compared with about 30 during 1967-82. The high positive correlation between the recent increase in the North Atlantic oscillation index and the pressure over most of the EM countries is linked to these tendencies in the synoptic systems.},

abstract = {Although many arid badland channels erode rapidly, channel flows appear to be rare, raising the issue of the character and frequency of flows responsible for channel erosion, Using an acoustic stream gauge, we recorded nine flash flood hydrographs over a 3 yr period from the Upper Blue Hills badlands, Utah, with maximum discharges up to similar to 0.9 m(3)/s. Flow hydrographs reveal bores and rapid depth changes that are similar to flash floods observed elsewhere. Bore and hydrograph peak translation velocities are greatest in narrow channel segments, Rapid runoff generation during short-duration thunderstorms produced complex hydrographs whose shapes appear to reflect channel network geometry, Storm runoff response is highly sensitive to antecedent moisture, which greatly reduces the regolith infiltration capacity, High antecedent moisture coupled with a relatively low intensity, long-duration rainstorm produced the largest flow event. Estimating flow frequency in this landscape therefore requires knowledge of the distributions of both storm sizes and temporal spacing relative to the short time required for the regolith infiltration capacity to recover following wetting, here roughly 24 hr, Landscape changes can be produced not only by rare, large rainfall events, but by a broad range of storm size and frequency under optimal antecedent moisture conditions.},

abstract = {Low-cost air quality sensors offer high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements that can be used for air resources management and exposure estimation. Yet, such sensors require frequent calibration to provide reliable data, since even after a laboratory calibration they might not report correct values when they are deployed in the field, due to interference with other pollutants, as a result of sensitivity to environmental conditions and due to sensor aging and drift. Field calibration has been suggested as a means for overcoming these limitations, with the common strategy involving periodical collocations of the sensors at an air quality monitoring station. However, the cost and complexity involved in relocating numerous sensor nodes back and forth, and the loss of data during the repeated calibration periods make this strategy inefficient. This work examines an alternative approach, a node-to-node (N2N) calibration, where only one sensor in each chain is directly calibrated against the reference measurements and the rest of the sensors are calibrated sequentially one against the other while they are deployed and collocated in pairs. The calibration can be performed multiple times as a routine procedure. This procedure minimizes the total number of sensor relocations, and enables calibration while simultaneously collecting data at the deployment sites. We studied N2N chain calibration and the propagation of the calibration error analytically, computationally and experimentally. The in-situ N2N calibration is shown to be generic and applicable for different pollutants, sensing technologies, sensor platforms, chain lengths, and sensor order within the chain. In particular, we show that chain calibration of three nodes, each calibrated for a week, propagate calibration errors that are similar to those found in direct field calibration. Hence, N2N calibration is shown to be suitable for calibration of distributed sensor networks. Node-to-node calibration is proposed as a general method for field calibration of wireless distributed air-quality sensor networks.},

Most of the epidemiological work assessing the health impacts of PM exposure concentrates on PM2.5, however, many of the PM monitoring records available for retrospective studies are of coarser PM10 data. This study explores the possibility to simulate PM2.5 data using PM10 records and assesses the trade-off between introduction of the unavoidable simulation errors and the improved spatial coverage enabled by the simulated series. Several modelling approaches are studied, bearing in mind the range of exposure time scales typical to environmental epidemiology studies. The modelling capability is evaluated by cross-testing between three stations observing both the PM2.5 and PM10 fractions. The trade-off between improved spatial coverage and simulation errors is assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation interpolations. Interpolations including both original and simulated data resulted in richer spatial patterns. Their cross-validated performance was comparable to or slightly better than that obtained using the original PM2.5 data only. The study provides methodologies and guidelines for scientists and practitioners on how to properly exploit their PM10 data to enhance their PM2.5 spatial coverage and minimise investment in new PM2.5 monitoring.},

abstract = {The concept of "catchment-scale storm velocity" quantifies the rate of storm motion up and down the basin accounting for the interaction between the rainfall space-time variability and the structure of the drainage network. It provides an assessment of the impact of storm motion on flood shape. We evaluate the catchment-scale storm velocity for the 29 August 2003 extreme storm that occurred on the 700 km(2)-wide Fella River basin in the eastern Italian Alps. The storm was characterized by the high rate of motion of convective cells across the basin. Analysis is carried out for a set of basins that range in area from 8 to 623 km(2) to: (a) determine velocity magnitudes for different sub-basins; (b) examine the relationship of velocity with basin scale and (c) assess the impact of storm motion on simulated flood response. Two spatially distributed hydrological models of varying degree of complexity in the representation of the runoff generation processes are used to evaluate the effects of the storm velocity on flood modelling and investigate model dependencies of the results. It is shown that catchment-scale storm velocity has a non-linear dependence on basin scale and generally exhibits rather moderate values, in spite of the strong kinematic characteristics of individual storm elements. Consistently with these observations and for both models, hydrological simulations show that storm motion has an almost negligible effect on the flood response modelling.},

abstract = {The lower Tordera River is a representative case of water and sediment dynamics and uses in a large river in the Western Mediterranean region. Along the study reach, the fluvial regime of the river changes, shifting from a perennial water and sediment circulation in the upper parts to an ephemeral flow pattern in the lower sections. The fluvial sediment budget of the lower Tordera was estimated based on field measurements of suspended and bedload and a survey of cross-sections. Field data were obtained between January 1997 and June 1999, a period that was dryer than the average. Most sediment is transported as bedload (more than 3/4 of the total load), both at the entrance section of the river reach and at the outlet section, close to the Mediterranean Sea. A total of 156,700 tonnes of sediment (62,680 tonnes/year) entered the system, mostly during discharges below bankfull, while 107,000 tonnes (42,800 tonnes/year) were exported to the sea, almost exclusively during floods. The net accumulation of sediment was 14,600 tonnes per year (as bedload), especially during the dry years of 1998 and 1999, when small floods circulated through the upper sections but did not reach the lowermost part of the river. As a consequence, a mean aggradation of the riverbed of around 6.8 mm/year has occurred, a figure that has been corroborated after the analysis of a series of cross-sections. Residence time of sediment in the perennial reach, calculated at a long-term, ranges from 6 years for sediments in the active base flow channel to 164 years for sediment placed above bankfull level, which is only entrained during high flows. Residence time of sediment in the ephemeral reach, calculated for the period 1997-1999, is only slightly higher than that of the perennial part of the river. This fact can be related to the current adjustment of the river system to historical mining. The riverbed is slowly adjusting to the new conditions, and important sedimentation is taking place in many upstream sections, while erosion still occurs in the lowermost reaches, thus causing the relatively low residence time of sediment. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cloud bands that extend from the ITCZ along the subtropical jet toward the subtropics are known as 'tropical plumes'. At times rainstorms develop at their subtropical edges. One such rainstorm swept eastern North Africa and the Middle East on 23-24 December 1988, with rainfall comparable with the annual averages there. This study examines the storm using the ECMWF initialized data together with surface observations and satellite imageries. The analysis indicates that the storm developed at the inflection region ahead of a pronounced trough in the subtropical jet, with which a mid-latitude trough was merged. Two ageostrophic effects taking place along the jet ahead of the trough contributed to the intensity of the rainstorm. One was associated with acceleration at the jet entrance, located at tropical latitudes, which contributed to the enhancement of both tropical convection and the southerly wind component, which enhanced the moisture tropical transport toward the subtropics. The second was the enhanced near-tropospheric divergence associated with positive vorticity advection at the inflection region itself. Since both effects have a quadratic dependence on wind speed, the observed jet speed, 50{\%} larger than its average value, explains the observed divergence at the inflection point at the 200 hPa level, over 6 x 10(-5) s(-1), and the vertical velocity at the 700 hPa level, about 10(-1) ms(-1). It is suggested here that the merging of a mid-latitude with the trough in the subtropical jet, with which the tropical plume is associated, is the cause for the intensification of the subtropical jet and hence of its related rainstorms.},

abstract = {In compliance with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, monitoring of the ecological and chemical status of Catalan river basins (NE Spain) is carried out by the Catalan Water Agency.The large amount of data collected and the complex relationships among the environmental variables monitored often mislead data interpretation in terms of toxic impact, especially considering that even pollutants at very low concentrations might contribute to the total toxicity.The total dataset of chemical monitoring carried out between 2007 and 2008 (232 sampling stations and 60 pollutants) has been analyzed using sequential advanced modeling techniques. Data on concentrations of contaminants in water were pre-treated in order to calculate the bioavailable fraction, depending on substance properties and local environmental conditions.The resulting values were used to predict the potential impact of toxic substances in complex mixtures on aquatic biota and to identify hot spots. Exposure assessment with Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) and mixture toxicity rules were used to compute the multi-substances Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAF).The combined toxicity of the pollutants analyzed in the Catalan surface waters might potentially impact more than 50{\%} of the species in 10{\%} of the sites.In order to understand and visualize the spatial distribution of the toxic risk, Self Organising Map (SOM), based on the Kohonen's Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, was applied on the output data of these models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on top of Neural Network results in order to identify main influential variables which account for the pollution trends. Finally, predicted toxic impacts on biota have been linked and correlated to field data on biological quality indexes using macroinvertebrate and diatom communities (IBMWP and IPS). The methodology presented could represent a suitable tool for water managers in environmental risk assessment and management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Channel Country rivers drain very large basins, have extremely variable annual flows, and experience very high relative flood magnitudes. Regional relationships describe how mean annual discharge, the average number and length of zero-flow periods, and event duration vary as power functions of drainage area. Flood flows (Q2, Q5, Q10, Q20) vary in a more complex way with drainage area, relationships changing from positive to negative because of increased transmission losses in the larger catchments. An event approach based on three distinct types of event—single, multiple, compound—provides an appropriate vehicle for analysing hydrologic variability. Single events have significantly smaller magnitudes, shorter durations and more rapid times-to-peak. Multiple events, although more akin to compound events than single ones overall, tend to occupy a middle ground, behaving more like single events at smaller runoff volumes and in smaller basins but more like compound ones at the other end of the scale. Generally there is a progressive increase in magnitude, duration, time-to-peak and level of unpredictability from single to compound events. Travel time, a more elusive variable to analyse, decreases log-linearly with increasing discharge in upper reaches but varies nonlinearly with discharge further downstream, reaching an intermediate maximum that is equated with the onset of floodplain flow.},

abstract = {Flash-flood warning models can save lives and protect various kinds of infrastructure. In dry climate regions, rainfall is highly variable and can be of high-intensity. Since rain gauge networks in such areas are sparse, rainfall information derived from weather radar systems can provide useful input for flash-flood models. This paper presents a flash-flood warning model which utilizes radar rainfall data and applies it to two catchments that drain into the dry Dead Sea region. Radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) were derived using a rain gauge adjustment approach, either on a daily basis (allowing the adjustment factor to change over time, assuming available real-time gauge data) or using a constant factor value (derived from rain gauge data) over the entire period of the analysis. The QPEs served as input for a continuous hydrological model that represents the main hydrological processes in the region, namely infiltration, flow routing and transmission losses. The infiltration function is applied in a distributed mode while the routing and transmission loss functions are applied in a lumped mode. Model parameters were found by calibration based on the 5 years of data for one of the catchments. Validation was performed for a subsequent 5-year period for the same catchment and then for an entire 10-year record for the second catchment. The probability of detection and false alarm rates for the validation cases were reasonable. Probabilistic flash-flood prediction is presented applying Monte Carlo simulations with an uncertainty range for the QPEs and model parameters. With low probability thresholds, one can maintain more than 70{\%} detection with no more than 30{\%} false alarms. The study demonstrates that a flash-flood warning model is feasible for catchments in the area studied. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We have done this to meet the growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and fuel. While changes to ecosystems have enhanced the well-being of billions of people, they have also caused a substantial and largely irreversible loss in diversity of life on Earth, and have strained the capacity of ecosystems to continue providing critical services. Among the findings: Approximately 60{\%} of the services that support life on Earth are being degraded or used unsustainably. The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years. Only four ecosystem services have been enhanced in the last 50 years: crops, livestock, aquaculture, and the sequestration of carbon. The capacity of ecosystems to neutralize pollutants, protect us from natural disasters, and control the outbreaks of pests and diseases is declining significantly. Terrestrial and freshwater systems are reaching the limits of their ability to absorb nitrogen. Harvesting of fish and other resources from coastal and marine systems is compromising their ability to deliver food in the future. Richly illustrated with maps and graphs, Current State and Trends presents an assessment of Earth's ability to provide twenty-four distinct services essential to human well-being. These include food, fiber, and other materials; the regulation of the climate and fresh water systems; underlying support systems such as nutrient cycling; and the fulfillment of cultural, spiritual, and aesthetic values.

We develop a high-resolution (15 min, 1 km2) radar rainfall data set for Charlotte, North Carolina during the 2001-2010 period using the Hydro-NEXRAD system with radar reflectivity from the National Weather Service Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler weather radar located in Greer, South Carolina. A dense network of 71 rain gages is used for estimating and correcting radar rainfall biases. Radar rainfall estimates with daily mean field bias (MFB) correction accurately capture the spatial and temporal structure of extreme rainfall, but bias correction at finer timescales can improve cold-season and tropical cyclone rainfall estimates. Approximately 25 rain gages are sufficient to estimate daily MFB over an area of at least 2,500 km2, suggesting that robust bias correction is feasible in many urban areas. Conditional (rain-rate dependent) bias can be removed, but at the expense of other performance criteria such as mean square error. Hydro-NEXRAD radar rainfall estimates are also compared with the coarser resolution (hourly, 16 km2) Stage IV operational rainfall product. Stage IV is adequate for flood water balance studies but is insufficient for applications such as urban flood modeling, in which the temporal and spatial scales of relevant hydrologic processes are short. We recommend the increased use of high-resolution radar rainfall fields in urban hydrology. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region can be considered as the most water-scarce region of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects strong changes in climate across MENA, further exacerbating pressure on available water resources. The objective of this study is to undertake a climate change assessment for 22 MENA countries in order to quantify the problems these countries may encounter up to 2050. To evaluate climate change in MENA, nine global circulation models representing two future periods (2020-2030 and 2040-2050) were statistically downscaled and compared with a current climate, defined as the period 2000-2009. Besides precipitation only this study also focuses on change in water demand by vegetation reference evapotranspiration (ETref). It was found that for both future periods the annual precipitation sum will decrease for the majority of countries, with decreases of 15-20{\%} for the latter period. For some countries, e.g. Djibouti and Yemen, an increase in annual precipitation of 15-20{\%} was found. The annual ETref shows an increase for all countries for both future periods, with the strongest increases for the latter period. For the extreme situation, it was found that the minimum monthly and annual precipitation sum does not become smaller in the future climate. It in fact increases. In contrast, the maximum monthly and annual ETref increases for all countries. This indicates that projected changes in demand are likely to have a more adverse effect than changes in supply. Spatial analysis showed that the largest precipitation decreases are to be found in southern Egypt, Morocco, central and coastal Algeria, Tunisia, central Libya, Syria, and central and eastern Iran. A case study for Morocco revealed that the potential water deficit, which is already apparent for the current climate, becomes even larger for the future climate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Land use regression (LUR) models rely on air pollutant measurements for their development, and are therefore limited to recent periods where such measurements are available. Here we propose an approach to overcome this gap and calculate LUR models several decades before measurements were available. We first developed a LUR model for NOx using annual averages of NOx at all available air quality monitoring sites in Israel between 1991 and 2011 with time as one of the independent variables. We then reconstructed historical spatial data (e.g., road network) from historical topographic maps to apply the model's prediction to each year from 1961 to 2011. The model's predictions were then validated against independent estimates about the national annual NOx emissions from on-road vehicles in a top-down approach. The model's cross validated R2 was 0.74, and the correlation between the model's annual averages and the national annual NOx emissions between 1965 and 2011 was 0.75. Information about the road network and population are persistent predictors in many LUR models. The use of available historical data about these predictors to resolve the spatial variability of air pollutants together with complementary national estimates on the change in pollution levels over time enable historical reconstruction of exposures.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study was to assess the ability of simple geometric measures of thunderstorm rainfall in explaining the runoff response from the watershed. For calculation of storm geometric properties (e.g. areal coverage of storm, areal coverage of the high-intensity portion of the storm, position of storm centroid and the movement of storm centroid in time), spatial information of rainfall is needed. However, generally the rainfall data consists of rainfall depth values over an unevenly spaced network of raingauges. For this study, rainfall depth values were available for 91 raingauges in a watershed of about 148 km2. There was a question about which interpolation method should be used for obtaining uniformly gridded data. Therefore, a small study was undertaken to compare cross-validation statistics and computed geometric parameters using two interpolation methods (kriging and multiquadric). These interpolation methods were used to estimate precipitation over a uniform 100 m ?? 100 m grid. The cross-validation results from the two methods were generally similar and neither method consistently performed better than the other did. In view of these results we decided to use multiquadric interpolation method for the rest of the study. Several geometric measures were then computed from interpolated surfaces for about 300 storm events occurring in a 17-year period. The correlation of these computed measures with basin runoff were then observed in an attempt to assess their relative importance in basin runoff response. It was observed that the majority of the storms (observed in the study) covered the entire watershed. Therefore, it was concluded that the areal coverage of storm was not a good indicator of the amount of runoff produced. The areal coverage of the storm core (10-min intensity greater than 25 mm/h), however, was found to be a much better predictor of runoff volume and peak rate. The most important variable in runoff production was found to be the volume of the storm core. It was also observed that the position of the storm core relative to the watershed outlet becomes more important as the catchment size increases, with storms positioned in the central portion of the watershed producing more runoff than those positioned near the outlet or near the head of the watershed. This observation indicates the importance of interaction of catchment size and shape with the spatial storm structure in runoff generation. Antecedent channel wetness was found to be of some importance in explaining runoff for the largest of the three watersheds studied but antecedent watershed wetness did not appreciably contributed to runoff explanation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20{\%}) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 {\%}.},

abstract = {This study examines the extent to which the floods in the Negev Desert, an area that constitutes the southern half of Israel, are not the outcome of purely local weather conditions but are, rather, the result of distinct synoptic-scale events. This was done through compiling and analysing a hydro-climatological database of all the major floods in the Negev, and then categorizing them manually into synoptic types that cause the major floods.The type analysis is based on the US National Meteorological Center data sets with 2.5° ׳ 2.5° resolution analysed by GrADS. Data were compiled and studied for 52 floods for the period 1965-94, with peak discharge above the magnitude of 5 year recurrence intervals (RI {\textgreater} 5 years) in at least one drainage basin.Distinct extreme synoptic patterns are indeed associated with 42 of the 52 floods. They were grouped into four synoptic types, two of which were associated with 37 events: (a) an active Red Sea trough, defined as a surface trough extending from East Africa through the Red Sea toward the eastern Mediterranean, accompanied by a pronounced trough at the 500 hPa level over eastern Egypt: (b) a Syrian low, defined as a well-developed Mediterranean cyclone accompanied by a pronounced upper-level trough, both located over Syria. Each of the four synoptic types has its own evolution course, and a unique seasonal and spatial distribution of its associated flooded basins.These findings imply that the major floods in the Negev can be considered as signatures of exceptional synoptic-scale evolutions, and that major floods reflect extreme climatic events. Our results indicate that it is possible to use a set of dynamic and thermodynamic variables for predicting the occurrence and location of major flash floods.

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to evaluate a threshold-based flash flood warning method, by considering a wide range of climatic and physiographic conditions, and by focusing on ungauged basins. The method is derived from the flash flood guidance (FFG, hereafter) approach. The FFG is the depth of rain of a given duration, taken as uniform in space and time on a certain basin, necessary to cause minor flooding at the outlet of the considered basin. This rainfall depth, which is computed based on a hydrological model, is compared to either real-time-observed or forecasted rainfall of the same duration and on the same basin. If the nowcasted or forecasted rainfall depth is greater than the FFG, then flooding in the basin is considered likely. The study provides an assessment of this technique based on operational quality data from 11 mountainous basins (six nested included in five larger parent basins) located in north-eastern Italy and central France. The model used in this study is a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of the PDM (probability distributed moisture) model. Two general questions are addressed: (1) How does the efficiency of the method evolve when the simulation parameters can not be calibrated but must be transposed from parent gauged basins to ungauged basins? (2) How sensitive are the results to the method used to estimate the initial soil moisture status? System performances are evaluated by means of categorical statistics, such as the critical success index (CSI). Results show that overall CSI is equal to 0.43 for the parent basins, where the hydrological model has been calibrated. CSI reduces to 0.28 for the interior basins, when model parameters are transposed from parent basins, and to 0.21, when both model parameters and soil moisture status is transposed from parent basins. Performance differences between FFG and use of time-constant soil moisture status are very high for the parent basins and decrease with decreasing the system accuracy. The percent difference amounts to 53{\%} for the parent basins, to 25{\%} for interior basins with parameter transposition, and to 19{\%} for interior basins with parameter and soil moisture status transposition. These results improve our understanding of the applicability and reliability of this method at various scales and under various scenarios of data availability. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A decadal-scale study to retrieve the spatio-temporal precipitation patterns of the Yangtze River basin, China, using the Tropical Rain Mapping Mission, Precipitation Radar (TRMM/PR) data is presented. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) based on monthly TRMM/PR data extracts several leading precipitation patterns, which are largely connected with physical implications at the basin scale. With the aid of gauge station data, the amplitudes of major principal components (PCs) were used to examine the generic relationships between precipitation variations and hydrological extremes (e. g. floods and droughts) during summer seasons over the past decade. The emergence of such major precipitation patterns clearly reveals the possible linkages with hydrological processes, and the oscillations in relation to the amplitude of major PCs are consistent with these observed hydrological extremes. Although the floods in some sections of the Yangtze River were, to some extent, tied to human activities, such as the removal of wetlands, the variations in major precipitation patterns are recognized as the primary driving force of the flow extremes associated with floods and droughts. The research findings indicate that long-distance hydro-meteorological signals of large-scale precipitation variations over such a large river basin can be successfully identified with the aid of EOF analysis. The retrieved precipitation patterns and their low-frequency jumps of amplitude in relation to PCs are valuable tools to help understand the association between the precipitation variations and the occurrence of hydrological extremes. Such a study can certainly aid in disaster mitigation and decision-making in water resource management.},

Event-based, semi-distributed rainfall-runoff modelling is undertaken. Alternative rainfall estimators (radar data and raingauge networks of various density) are considered and their effects on simulated runoff evaluated as a function of rainfall type, catchment type and catchment scale. An index of spatial variability is defined, based on the difference between the reference rainfall (defined by the full raingauge network) and alternative rainfall estimators. A modified Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion measures the performance of the simulated runoff with respect to reference simulated runoff. Results show a complex picture. The dominant effect is the spatial variability of the rainfall. No clear pattern emerges as a function of catchment scale, or response time, except that the impact of spatial variability is damped at the whole catchment scale. The sensitivity to spatial rainfall is enhanced on urbanised catchments. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Three fish species showed the different behavioral patterns after the exposure of test chemicals.

Part B provides the geological history, including evidence of substantial Tertiary and Quaternary climate change. Part C covers the contemporary environmental conditions, and Part D presents a conclusion and summary. This not only represents the first comprehensive review of current knowledge of any of the world's truly large dryland drainage basins, but also highlights how more multi-disciplinary research is required. Key remaining questions revolve around the impact of global weather systems on the LEB; the lake-level story in relation to a more precise picture of Late Quaternary climate change; the role of humans and climate in the demise of the megafauna; modern hydrological changes; the role of vegetation in altering channel morphology and flow efficiencies; and nature of flood transmissions.},

abstract = {During the period 1996–2000, forty-three heavy rainfall events have been detected in the Internal Basins of Catalonia (Northeastern of Spain). Most of these events caused floods and serious damage. This high number leads to the need for a methodology to classify them, on the basis of their surface rainfall distribution, their internal organization and their physical features. The aim of this paper is to showa methodology to analyze systematically the convective struc- tures responsible of those heavy rainfall events on the basis of the information supplied by the meteorological radar. The proposed methodology is as follows. Firstly, the rainfall in- tensity and the surface rainfall pattern are analyzed on the basis of the raingauge data. Secondly, the convective struc- tures at the lowest level are identified and characterized by using a 2-D algorithm, and the convective cells are identified by using a 3-D procedure that looks for the reflectivity cores in every radar volume. Thirdly, the convective cells (3-D) are associated with the 2-D structures (convective rainfall areas). This methodology has been applied to the 43 heavy rainfall events using the meteorological radar located near Barcelona and the SAIH automatic raingauge network.},

abstract = {This is the first of two papers that describe the surface hydrology of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) (1,140,000km2) in central Australia and compares some key characteristics with those observed from arid regions globally. This paper concentrates on annual rainfall, whereas the second paper is devoted to streamflow. The first part describes the LEB's climate (arid to semi-arid), which is dominated by a subtropical high pressure ridge stretching latitudinally across central Australia. Then follow major analyses that include the characteristics of rainfall, wet and dry spell lengths and cumulative surpluses and deficiencies, rainfall trends and intra- and inter-decadal fluctuations, and the relationship between rainfall and El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The paper concludes with six conclusions, the key ones being: the variability of the annual rainfall (based on the coefficient of variation) in the LEB is approximately 60{\%} greater than that found for stations located in arid regions in the rest of the world; there is a bias towards longer lengths of dry years than observed in the rest of Australia; and, there is a significant lag correlation between rainfall and ENSO, particularly in the east and in the latter part of a year.},

abstract = {Extreme rainfall is quantified in engineering practice using Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves (IDF) that are traditionally derived from rain-gauges and more recently also from remote sensing instruments, such as weather radars. These instruments measure rainfall at different spatial scales: rain-gauge samples rainfall at the point scale while weather radar averages precipitation on a relatively large area, generally around 1km2. As such, a radar derived IDF curve is representative of the mean areal rainfall over a given radar pixel and neglects the within-pixel rainfall variability. In this study, we quantify subpixel variability of extreme rainfall by using a novel space-time rainfall generator (STREAP model) that downscales in space the rainfall within a given radar pixel. The study was conducted using a unique radar data record (23years) and a very dense rain-gauge network in the Eastern Mediterranean area (northern Israel). Radar-IDF curves, together with an ensemble of point-based IDF curves representing the radar subpixel extreme rainfall variability, were developed fitting Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions to annual rainfall maxima. It was found that the mean areal extreme rainfall derived from the radar underestimate most of the extreme values computed for point locations within the radar pixel (on average, ∼70{\%}). The subpixel variability of rainfall extreme was found to increase with longer return periods and shorter durations (e.g. from a maximum variability of 10{\%} for a return period of 2years and a duration of 4h to 30{\%} for 50years return period and 20min duration). For the longer return periods, a considerable enhancement of extreme rainfall variability was found when stochastic (natural) climate variability was taken into account. Bounding the range of the subpixel extreme rainfall derived from radar-IDF can be of major importance for different applications that require very local estimates of rainfall extremes.},

Data from 113 climate stations for temperatures (mean, maximum and minimum) and total precipitation from 1951 to 1998 are used after standardizing with zero mean and unit variance, to confirm that all variables are weighted equally in the cluster analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis is chosen to perform the regionalization. Five different techniques were applied initially to decide the most suitable method for the region. Stability of the clusters is also tested. It is decided that Ward's method is the most likely to yield acceptable results in this particular case, as is often the case in climatological research. Seven different climate zones are found, as in conventional climate zones, but with considerable differences at the boundaries. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {No consensus has yet been reached regarding the influence of rainfall spatial variability on runoff modelling at catchment outlets. To eliminate modelling and measurement errors, in addition to controlling rainfall variability and both the characteristics and hydrological behaviour of catchments, we propose to proceed by simulation. We have developed a simulation chain that combines a stream network model, a rainfall simulator and a distributed hydrological model (with four production functions and a distributed transfer function). Our objective here is to use this simulation chain as a simplified test bed in order to better understand the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall forcing. We applied the chain to contrasted situations involving catchments ranging from a few tens to several hundreds of square km2, thus corresponding to urban and peri-urban catchments for which surface runoff constitutes the dominant process. The results obtained confirm that the proposed simulation approach is helpful to better understand the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the catchment response. We have shown that significant dispersion exists not only between the various simulation scenarios (defined by a rainfall configuration and a catchment configuration), but also within each simulation scenario. These results show that the organisation of rainfall during the study event over the study catchment plays an important role, leading us to examine rainfall variability indexes capable of summarising the influence of rainfall spatial organisation on the catchment response. Thanks to the simulation chain, we have tested the variability indexes of Zoccatelli et al. (2010) and improved them by proposing two other indexes.},

abstract = {Dewfall can be a substantial water resource crucial for maintaining water balance in desert ecosystems such as the hyper-arid zone of the Taklimakan Desert in China. However, little is known about the formation, quantitative characteristics, and factors influencing dewfall in this region. This study elucidates dew formation and its long-term trend in this region using observational data, including flux, meteorological, and soil water content data obtained using the Eddy covariance system and those recorded by a weather station in the area. The results are as follows: (1) Dew forms in the Populus forest, with nighttime dewfall duration being about 2. h. The average daily dewfall amount during the observation period (June 4-October 24, 2011) was 0.12. mm. The number of dewfall days was 104. days (73{\%} of total days), and the cumulative dewfall amount was 12.87. mm. (2) The dewfall days and amounts on the canopy and soil surfaces were 86. days and 8.64. mm, and 38. days and 4.23. mm, respectively. The top soil can absorb more water vapor than condensed dew. (3) At different time scales (half-hour, day, and half-year), obvious variations in dewfall duration, dewfall amounts, and meteorological factors occurred. (4) Over the past 51. years, changes in the number of dewfall days during the summer (June-October) exhibited a trend similar to that of changes in total dewfall amount during the same period. The average dewfall amount during the summer half-year was 17.2. mm, which is about 64{\%} of the summer half-year rainfall and 50{\%} of the annual rainfall. In particular, the total dewfall amount was higher than the annual rainfall amount during the one-fifth of the past 51. years. The study proved dewfall is one of important water resources in the arid Taklimakan Desert region, and it also significantly influenced the water balance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Simultaneous observations made with optical- and impact-type disdrometers were analyzed to broaden knowledge of these instruments. These observations were designed to test how accurately they measure drop size distributions (DSDs). The instruments' use in determining radar rainfall relations such as that between reflectivity and rainfall rate also was analyzed. A unique set of instruments, including two video and one Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer along with eight tipping-bucket rain gauges, was operated within a small area of about 100 × 50 m2 during a 2-month-long field campaign in central Florida. The disdrometers were evaluated by comparing their rain totals with the rain gauges. Both disdrometers underestimated the rain totals, but the video disdrometers had higher readings, resulting in a better agreement with the gauges. The disdrometers underreported small- to medium-size drops, which most likely caused the underestimation of rain totals. However, more medium-size drops were measured by the video disdrometer, thus producing higher rain rates for that instrument. The comparison of DSDs, averaged at different timescales, showed good agreement between the two types of disdrometers. A continuous increase in the number of drops toward smaller sizes was only evident in the video disdrometers at rain rates above 20 mm h−1. Otherwise, the concentration of small drops remained the same or decreased to the smallest measurable size. The Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer severely underestimated only at very small drop size (diameter ≤ 0.5 mm). Beyond the Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer measurement limit were very large drops that fell during heavy and extreme rain intensities. The derived parameters of exponential and gamma distributions reflect the good agreement between the disdrometers' DSD measurements. The parameters of fitted distributions were close to each other, especially when all the coincident measurements were averaged. The low concentrations of very large drops observed by the video disdrometers did not have a significant impact on reflectivity measurements in terms of the relationships between reflectivity and other integral parameters (rain rate, liquid water content, and attenuation). There was almost no instrument dependency. Rather, the relations depend on the method of regression and the choice of independent variable. Also, relationships derived for S-band radars and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) differ from each other primarily because of the higher reflectivities at the shorter PR wavelength at high rain-rate regime.},

abstract = {We propose a new simplified vision of flood dynamics through temporal and spatial scales to enhance understanding of potential and limits of human responses to flash floods. Based on data from a set of extreme flash floods that occurred in Europe, we analyze both the runoff response time of flash floods and the asynchronous character of flood peak time generation. We introduce the concept of "timeliness" to quantify the balance in time between the hydrological response of catchments to heavy storms and the human reactions. Timeliness is investigated across the range of spatial scales of concern for flash floods and for various types of anticipation actions. Results are reported for four extreme flash flood events occurred since 2002 in France, Italy and Slovenia. These results indicate that human actions adapt their pace to the physical context and are in a kind of "hurrying" process as the flood danger approaches in time. They show the importance of self-organization and 'unofficial' warning in response to flash flooding by individuals and groups. The work draws on flood hazard research findings from hydrology, meteorology and social science and put forward a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration between hydrologists and social scientists. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {High-resolution maps of the mean concentrations of SO2, NO, NO2, O3, and PM10in the period 2002-2004 were produced using half-hourly data from the local air quality monitoring network in Haifa Bay area, Israel. The network consists of 20 monitoring stations within an area of 206 km2, which encompasses a major industrial and power generation centre in the midst of a population of about 500 000. The pollutants' spatial features agree well with their known sources and the expected dispersion by the prevailing meteorology. The ranking of their spatial variations agree with published observations on larger spatial scales. The high-resolution maps capture in a small spatial scale the NOxand O3cycle relationships expected by theory, and previously observed by analyses of monitoring time series. High correlation was found between the spatial patterns of the PM10, NOxand O3, whereas the correlation between the spatial features of the PM10and SO2is low. This suggests that the traffic, a major source of NOx, rather than industry, the major source of SO2, is the main contributor to the anthropogenic PM10in the study area. This inference is corroborated by the low sulphur to nitrogen ratio throughout the region, which is typical of traffic-dominated pollution. A general conclusion drawn from this study is that high-resolution monitoring and mapping can significantly contribute to air quality management programmes in terms of both pollution abatement and exposure and risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A positive relationship between annual rainfall and geomorphic processes (runoff and erosion rates) and environmental factors (water regime, soil and vegetation cover) is often assumed for arid and semi-arid areas with an annual rainfall in the range of 100-300 mm. This assumption disregards the fact that changes along a climatic gradient, at desert margins, are not limited to purely climatic factors. They are often accompanied by a parallel change in surface properties; especially the relative extent of rocky or soil covered surfaces that differ greatly in their response to rainfall. This raises the issue whether the change in surface properties along a climatic gradient enhances the assumed positive effects of rainfall increase or limits it. The hypothesis advanced in this paper is that runoff generation and rate in arid and semi-arid areas are primarily controlled by surface properties rather than by the absolute amounts of storm and annual rain amounts. Hydrological data collected at two instrumented watersheds, located one in an arid rocky area, and the second in a semi-arid soil covered area, support this hypothesis. The implications of data obtained for runoff generation and flow continuity under changing climatic conditions are analyzed. They point to the fact that the same regional climatic change may have different, and even opposite effects, on the hydrological response of different adjoining surface units. This response is expected to be strongly controlled by the specific local surface conditions that prevailed in the area prior to the climatic change. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The Charlotte, North Carolina, metropolitan area has experienced extensive urban and suburban growth since 1960. Five of the largest flood peaks in the 74-yr discharge record of Little Sugar Creek, which drains the central urban corridor of Charlotte, have occurred since August of 1995. A central objective of this study is to explain how these two observations are linked. To achieve this goal, a series of hypotheses of broad importance to the hydrology and hydrometeorology behavior of extreme floods will be examined. These hypotheses concern the roles of 1) space–time variability of rainfall, 2) antecedent soil moisture, 3) expansion of impervious area, and 4) alterations of the drainage network for extreme floods in urbanizing drainage basins. The methodology used to examine these hypotheses centers on diagnostic studies of flood response for the five major flood events that have occurred since August of 1995. Diagnostic studies exploit the diverse range of extreme precipitation forcing for the five events and heterogeneity of land surface properties for catchments with stream gauging records. The observational resources for studying flood response in the Charlotte metropolitan region are exceptional. They include two National Weather Service WSR-88D radars that were deployed in 1995, a dense network of rain gauges and stream gauges installed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1995, and extensive land surface datasets developed by Mecklenburg County. This study focuses on the regional hydrology of extreme flood response, as opposed to the specific effects of individual elements of the constructed environment. Of particular interest are the hydrologic, hydraulic, and hydrometeorological controls of extreme flood response at basin scales ranging from 1 to 500 km[sup 2] . [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Some recent developments in the stochastic modelling of single site and spatial rainfall are summarised. Alternative single site models based on Poisson cluster processes are introduced, fitting methods are discussed, and performance is compared for representative UK hourly data. The representation of sub-hourly rainfall is discussed, and results from a temporal disaggregation scheme are presented. Extension of the Poisson process methods to spatial-temporal rainfall, using radar data, is reported. Current methods assume spatial and temporal stationarity; work in progress seeks to relax these restrictions. Unlike radar data, long sequences of daily raingauge data are commonly available, and the use of generalized linear models (GLMs) (which can represent both temporal and spatial non-stationarity) to represent the spatial structure of daily rainfall based on raingauge data is illustrated for a network in the North of England. For flood simulation, disaggregation of daily rainfall is required. A relatively simple methodology is described, in which a single site Poisson process model provides hourly sequences, conditioned on the observed or GLM-simulated daily data. As a first step, complete spatial dependence is assumed. Results from the River Lee catchment, near London, are promising. A relatively comprehensive set of methodologies is thus provided for hydrological application.},

abstract = {Identification of a geomorphic index to represent lower thresholds for minor flows in ephemeral, alluvial streams in arid environments is an essential step in reliable flash flood hazard estimations and establishing flood warning systems. An index, termed Alluvial wadi Flood Incipient Geomorphologic Index (AFIG), is presented. Analysis of data from an extensive field survey in the arid ephemeral streams in southern and eastern Israel was conducted to investigate the AFIG and the control over its value across the region. During the survey we identified distinguishable flow marks in the lower parts of streams' banks, such as niches, vegetation line, and change in bank material, which are indicative of low flows. The cross-sectional characteristics of the AFIG were studied in relationship with contributing drainage basin characteristics such as lithology, topography, and precipitation. Drainage area and hardness of the exposed lithology (presented as a basin-wide index) are the preferred descriptors to be used in estimating a specific AFIG in un-surveyed sites. Analyses of discharge records from seven hydrometric stations indicate that the recurrence interval of the determined AFIG is equal to or more frequent than 0.5 year.},

abstract = {Catchment sediment budgeting is an attempt to identify the sources, sinks and pathways of eroded material within catchments. However, the identification of these quantities is not straightforward, and the conceptual underpinnings of sediment budgets make unwarranted and untested assumptions about process stability. Many sediment budgets leave one or more quantities unmeasured and obtain estimates of them by subtraction (assuming budget closure). Consequently, errors in sediment budgets are often hidden and are not quantified. There has been an emphasis on suspended sediment, which, for management purposes, may not be useful. Sediment budgeting can act as a framework for a research agenda on catchment processes. What has been lacking from this agenda has been an adequate consideration of the time taken for sediment to travel via the various pathways to the catchment outlet. The storage term in such budgets has been used as a poor substitute for a thorough understanding of sediment velocity through catchments.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to evaluate daily rain rates derived from three widely used high-resolution satellite precipitation products (PERSIANN, TMPA-3B42V7, and TMPA-3B42RT) using rain gauge observations over the entire country of Iran. Evaluations are implemented for 47 comprehensive daily rainfall events during the winter and spring seasons from 2003 to 2006. These events are selected because each encompasses more than 50{\%} of the country?s area. In this study, daily rainfall observations derived from 1180 rain gauges distributed throughout the country are employed as reference surface data. Six statistical indices: bias, multiplicative bias (MBias), relative bias (RBias), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and linear correlation coefficient (CC), as well as a contingency table are applied to evaluate the satellite rainfall estimates qualitatively. The spatially averaged results over the entire country indicate that 3B42V7, with an average bias value of ?1.47 mmd?1, RBias of ?13.6{\%}, MAE of 4.5 mmd?1, RMSE of 6.5 mmd?1, and CC of 0.61, leads to better estimates of daily precipitation than those of PERSIANN and 3B42RT. Furthermore, PERSIANN with an average MBias value of 0.56 tends to underestimate precipitation, while 3B42V7 and 3B42RT with average MBias values of 0.86 and 1.02, respectively, demonstrate a reasonable agreement in regard to rainfall estimations with the rain gauge data. With respect to the categorical verification technique implemented in this study, PERSIANN exhibits better results associated with the probability of detection of rainfall events; however, its false alarm ratio is worse than that of 3B42V7 and 3B42RT.},

abstract = {The lack of adequate field measurements often hampers the construction and calibration of rainfall‐runoff models over many of the world's watersheds. We adopted methodologies that rely heavily on readily available remote sensing datasets as viable alternatives for assessing, managing, and modelling of such remote and inadequately gauged regions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was selected for continuous (1998–2005) rainfall‐runoff modelling of one such area, the northeast part of the Pishin Lora basin (NEPL). Input to the model included satellite‐based Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation data, and modelled runoff was calibrated against satellite‐based observations, the latter included: (i) monthly estimates of the water volumes impounded by the Khushdil Khan (latitude 30°40′N, longitude 67°40′E), and the Kara Lora (latitude 30°34′N, longitude 66°52′E) reservoirs, and (ii) inferred wet versus dry conditions in streams across the NEPL. Calibrations were also conducted against observed flow reported from the Burj Aziz Khan station at the NEPL outlet (latitude 30°20′N; longitude 66°35′E). Model simulations indicate that (i) average annual precipitation (1998–2005), runoff and recharge in the NEPL are 1300 × 106 m3, 148 × 106 m3, and 361 × 106 m3, respectively; (ii) within the NEPL watershed, precipitation and runoff are high for the northeast (precipitation: 194 mm/year; runoff: 38 × 106 m3/year) and northwest (134 mm/year; 26 × 106 m3/year) basins compared to the southern basin (124 mm/year; 8 × 106 m3/year); and (3) construction of delay action dams in the northeast and northwest basins could increase recharge from 361 × 106 m3/year up to 432 × 106 m3/year and achieve sustainable extraction. The adopted methodologies are not a substitute for traditional approaches, but they could provide first‐order estimates for rainfall, runoff, and recharge in the arid and semi‐arid parts of the world that are inaccessible and/or lack adequate coverage with field data.},

abstract = {This study introduces a new conceptual model to explain the recently observed changes in winter precipitation over Israel. The model is based on our earlier published work (where a connection was reported between the occurrence of major rain days (MRDs) in different parts of the country and three prototypes, A, B and C, of the 500 hPa trough axis orientation prevailing on MRDs) and on additional results obtained by an extension of that work in the present paper. The first part of the present study is devoted to the extension of our early work. Composite techniques have been used on National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-National Meteorological Center grid-point data for the rain seasons 1981-82 to 1985-86 to identify the sea-level pressure (SLP) distribution associated with each of the three 500 hPa prototypes. Prototype A (trough axis oriented from northwest to southeast, earlier shown to be associated with MRDs in northern Israel) was found in the present work to be associated with a surface low in the vicinity of Antalya, southern Turkey. Prototype B (trough axis oriented from north to south, earlier shown to be associated with MRDs in central Israel) was found in the present work to be associated with a surface low over southeastern Turkey. Prototype C (trough axis oriented from northeast to southwest, earlier shown to be associated with MRDs in southern Israel) was found to be associated with elevated surface pressure over northwestern Turkey and a trough over eastern Turkey. In the second part of the study we used our results to construct a conceptual model of the mechanism responsible for the relative increases in seasonal (winter) rainfall over the southern part of the country and the decrease over the north. Using National Centers for Environmental Prediction-NCAR reanalysis data for the period 1982-2000, we demonstrated that the direct atmospheric agent responsible for this change in the spatial rainfall distribution is an increased frequency of occurrence of 500 hPa troughs oriented from northeast to southwest (Prototype C) accompanied by prominent positive SLP anomalies centred over Turkey. Our analysis further shows that these atmospheric systems are consistent with the persistence of a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the one hand and with latest IPCC predictions of precipitation patterns over the eastern Mediterranean basin on the other hand.

abstract = {The spaceborne weather radar onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite can be used to adjust Ground-based Radar (GR) echoes, as a function of the range from the GR site. The adjustment is based on the average linear radar reflectivity in circular rings around the GR site, for both the GR and attenuation-corrected . NearSurfZ TRMM Precipitation Radar (TPR) images. In previous studies, it was found that in winter, for the lowest elevation of the Cyprus C-band radar, the GR/TPR equivalent rain rate ratio was decreasing, on average, of approximately 8. dB per decade. In this paper, the same analysis has been applied to another C-band radar in the southeastern Mediterranean area. For the lowest elevation of the "Shacham" radar in Israel, the GR/TPR equivalent rain rate ratio is found to decrease of approximately 6. dB per decade. The average departure at the "reference", intermediate range is related to the calibration of the GR. The negative slope of the range dependence is considered to be mainly caused by an overshooting problem (increasing sampling volume of the GR with range combined with non-homogeneous beam filling and, on average, a decreasing vertical profile of radar reflectivity). To check this hypothesis, we have compared the same . NearSurfZ TPR images versus GR data acquired using the second elevation. We expected these data to be affected more by overshooting, especially at distant ranges: the negative slope of the range dependence was in fact found to be more evident than in the case of the lowest GR elevation for both the Cypriot and Israeli radar. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rainfall and wind data obtained from a dense raingage network on a 4.4 ha semiarid catchment were used as input to a distributed rainfall-runoff model. It was shown that the wind direction and velocity have a relatively small impact on peak rate and runoff volume for this low relief watershed. However, even at this small scale, spatial variability of precipitation can translate into large variations in modeled runoff. When five model runs were conducted using input from one of five recording raingages, one at a time, the coefficient of variation for peak rate and runoff volume ranged from 9 to 76{\%}, and from 2 to 65{\%}, respectively, over eight observed storm events. By using four well distributed gages the variations in modeled runoff volume approach the sampling resolution of the raingages as well as the estimated accuracy of runoff volume and peak rate observations. The results of this study indicate that if distributed catchment modeling is to be conducted at the 5 ha scale in an environment dominated by convective air-mass thunderstorm rainfall, knowledge of the spatial rainfall variability on the same scale is required. A single raingage with the standard uniform rainfall assumption can lead to large uncertainties in runoff estimation.},

Extreme flooding in the Delaware River basin is the product of heavy rainfall and runoff from high-gradient portions of the watershed. Orographic precipitation mechanisms play a central role in the extreme flood climatology of the Delaware River basin and, more generally, for the eastern United States.

This holds in particular for vulnerable regions, such as the Levant, already subjected to decrease in rainfall and lengthening of dry spells, in agreement with predictions of climatic models for the coming decades. This is the first comprehensive study which identifies atmospheric patterns responsible for PDS occurrence on thousands of kilometres scale. A total of 178 PDSs, of {\textgreater}7 days, were found within the 62 seasons studied. A subjective inspection of upper-level geopotential height (GPH), sea-level pressure (SLP) and lower-level temperature anomalies point at three types, each associated with a definite climatic regime. The ‘subtropical' type is associated with an expansion of the subtropical high over the majority of the Mediterranean, accompanied by northward migration of the Mediterranean cyclone track. The ‘baroclinic', the most frequent type, is induced by a pronounced stagnant ridge over the eastern Mediterranean, being a part of Rossby wave, accompanied by a pronounced trough/cut-off low over the western Mediterranean. The ‘polar' type results from intrusion of lower-level continental polar air associated with upper-level trough east of the Levant and blocking high over central Europe. Quantitative indices were derived for objective classification of the types, based on the climatic regimes defined subjectively, and the centers of action representing each. Composite maps for each type indicate substantial differences in the synoptic configuration and the factors explaining absence of rain. For the subtropical type, the dynamic factor of subsidence is dominant. For the polar, the thermodynamic factor of continental dry advection is dominant and for the baroclinic, both dynamic and thermodynamic factors are important. Classification of PDSs according to synoptic scenarios enables analysis of future changes in the occurrence and duration pattern of PDSs, using output of climate models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a storm catalog of heavy rainfall events for a region centered on the Milwaukee, Wisconsin WSR-88D (Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler) radar. The study region includes portions of southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Lake Michigan. The long-term objective of this study is to develop rainfall frequency analysis methods based on a storm catalog of major rain events. The specific objectives of this study are to develop a long-term catalog of high-resolution radar rainfall fields and characterize key features of the space-time variability of rainfall. The research questions that underlie these objectives are: 1) What are the spatial heterogeneities of rainfall over the study region for major flood-producing storm systems? 2) What are the key elements of storm evolution that control the scale-dependent properties of extreme rainfall? The storm catalog contains a record of the 50 "largest" storm days during the 1996-2011 observation period. We show that mean rainfall for the 50 largest storm days exhibits pronounced spatial heterogeneity with a broad maximum in western Wisconsin and a minimum in the eastern portion of the study region over Lake Michigan. We also show that there is a narrow line of maximum mean rainfall extending from west to east along the Wisconsin-Illinois border. This feature is tied to a maximum in the probability of daily rainfall exceeding 100mm. There are characteristic elements to the storm life cycle of heavy rainfall days that relate to size, structure and evolution of heavy rainfall. Extreme rainfall is also linked with severe weather (tornados, large hail and damaging wind). The diurnal cycle of rainfall for heavy rain days is characterized by an early peak in the largest rainfall rates, an afternoon-evening peak in rain area exceeding 25mmh-1 and development of a large stratiform rain area during the night and early morning. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The predictive utility of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for several runoff events within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for different events and that real-time parameter updating may be preferable.},

abstract = {This paper examines, for the first time, the unique situation of a groundwater system adjacent to a long-term stratified (meromictic) lake. Using conceptual and numerical models, the configuration of groundwater interfaces between the three different water bodies (regional groundwater and upper and lower lake waters) and the flow patterns were quantitatively evaluated assuming a homogenous aquifer. A complex flow system, controlled by density difference, is created near the lake, where three circulation cells are developed. These results are different from the classic circulation cell that is found adjacent to nonstratified water bodies (lakes or oceans). Sensitivity analyses reveal that the results are sensitive to changes in thickness and density of the upper water mass of the lake. The Dead Sea, under its possible future meromictic conditions, serves as an ideal example of such a system. Thus, the model's results can be used as a preliminary assessment for groundwater behavior adjacent to the lake, if and when stratification will develop.},

abstract = {This study deals with the reliability of monitoring the transition zone between fresh and saline waters in coastal aquifers, considering the effect of tides in long-perforated boreholes. Electric conductivity (EC) fluctuations in the coastal aquifer of Israel, as measured in long-perforated borehole, were found to have the same periodicities as the sea tide, though some orders of magnitude larger than sea-level or groundwater level fluctuations. Direct measurements in the aquifer through buried EC sensors demonstrate that EC measurements within the long-perforated boreholes might be distorted due to vertical flow in the boreholes, whereas actual fluctuations of the transition zone within the aquifer are some orders of magnitude smaller. Considering these field data, we suggest that monitoring of the transition zone between fresh and saline water adjacent to the sea through long-perforated boreholes is unreliable. EC fluctuations in short-perforated boreholes (1 m perforation at the upper part of the transition zone) were somewhat larger than in the aquifer, but much smaller than those in the long-perforated borehole. The short-perforation diminishes the vertical flow and the distortion and therefore is more reliable for monitoring the transition zone in the shoreline vicinity.},

abstract = {No consensus has yet been reached regarding the influence of rainfall spatial variability on runoff modelling at catchment outlets. To eliminate modelling and measurement errors, in addition to controlling rainfall variability and both the characteristics and hydrological behaviour of catchments, we propose to proceed by simulation. We have developed a simulation chain that combines a stream network model, a rainfall simulator and a distributed hydrological model (with four production functions and a distributed transfer function). Our objective here is to use this simulation chain as a simplified test bed in order to better understand the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall forcing. We applied the chain to contrasted situations involving catchments ranging from a few tens to several hundreds of square km2, thus corresponding to urban and peri-urban catchments for which surface runoff constitutes the dominant process. The results obtained confirm that the proposed simulation approach is helpful to better understand the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the catchment response. We have shown that significant dispersion exists not only between the various simulation scenarios (defined by a rainfall configuration and a catchment configuration), but also within each simulation scenario. These results show that the organisation of rainfall during the study event over the study catchment plays an important role, leading us to examine rainfall variability indexes capable of summarising the influence of rainfall spatial organisation on the catchment response. Thanks to the simulation chain, we have tested the variability indexes of Zoccatelli et al. (2010) and improved them by proposing two other indexes.},

abstract = {Abstract An approach to forecasting the potential for flash flood-producing storms is developed, using the notion of basic ingredients. Heavy precipitation is the result of sustained high rainfall rates. In turn, high rainfall rates involve the rapid ascent of air containing substantial water vapor and also depend on the precipitation efficiency. The duration of an event is associated with its speed of movement and the size of the system causing the event along the direction of system movement. This leads naturally to a consideration of the meteorological processes by which these basic ingredients are brought together. A description of those processes and of the types of heavy precipitation-producing storms suggests some of the variety of ways in which heavy precipitation occurs. Since the right mixture of these ingredients can be found in a wide variety of synoptic and mesoscale situations, it is necessary to know which of the ingredients is critical in any given case.

abstract = {Weathering in carbonate rocks is often assumed to be governed by chemical dissolution. Nevertheless, chemical processes can be coupled to mechanical mechanisms, with small grains undergoing partial dissolution along grain boundaries, followed by detachment from the rock surface. Crucially, this process can even extend down to the micron-scale. Although chemo-mechanical detachment could be critical for the understanding of carbonate weathering at the global scale, the role it plays has not been directly quantified. To calculate the contribution of grain detachment to surface retreat rates, and to determine the impact of the flow regime, we carried out a series of flow-through weathering experiments on micritic limestone. Using atomic force microscopy, we obtained high resolution in situ data of surface topography for reacting rock surfaces. In all the experiments, both grain detachment and chemical dissolution were observed. Under the laminar flow conditions we explored, we found no clear correlation between flow rate and the size of detached grains, or between the flow rate and the frequency of grain detachment events. Importantly, our results establish that grain detachment contributes significantly to the overall surface retreat, on average accelerating mass loss by 38{\%}. In addition to speeding up weathering, this micron-scale mechanism could also influence the evolution of porosity in aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs, and provide a natural flux of colloids that could transport heavy metals or radionuclides in groundwater.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This review discusses published studies of heavy rainfall events over the Mediterranean Basin, combining them in a more general picture of the dynamic and thermodynamic factors and processes that produce heavy rain storms. It distinguishes the western and eastern Mediterranean in order to point out specific regional peculiarities. The crucial moisture for developing intensive convection over these regions can be originated not only from the adjacent Mediterranean Sea but also from distant upwind sources. Transport from remote sources is usually in the mid-tropospheric layers and associated with specific features and patterns of the larger-scale circulations. The synoptic systems (tropical and extratropical) that account for most of the major extreme precipitation events and the coupling of circulation and extreme rainfall patterns are presented. Heavy rainfall over the Mediterranean Basin is caused at times in concert by several atmospheric processes working at different atmospheric scales, such as local convection, upper synoptic-scale-level troughs, and mesoscale convective systems. Under tropical air-mass intrusions, convection generated by static instability seems to play a more important role than synoptic-scale vertical motions. Locally, the occurrence of torrential rains and their intensity is dependent on factors such as temperature profiles and implied instability, atmospheric moisture, and lower-level convergence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Aridity prevails over more than one third of the land area of the Earth and over a significant fraction of the oceans as well. Yet to date there has been no comprehensive reference volume or textbook dealing with the weather processes that define the character of desert areas. Desert Meteorology fills this gap by treating all aspects of desert weather, such as large-scale and local-scale causes of aridity; precipitation characteristics in deserts; dust storms; floods; climate change in deserts; precipitation processes; desertification; land-surface physics of deserts; numerical modelling of desert atmospheres; and the effect of desert weather on humans. A summary is provided of the climates and surface properties of the desert areas of the world. The book is written with the assumption that the reader has only a basic knowledge of meteorology, physics and calculus, making it useful to those in a wide range of disciplines. It includes review questions and problems for the student. This comprehensive volume will satisfy all who need to know more about the weather and climate of arid lands. It will appeal especially to advanced students and researchers in environmental science, meteorology, physical geography, hydrology and engineering.},

The framework includes data quality assurance and quality control processes, automated kriging interpolation along undulating paths, and local hotspot and cluster analyses. These methods are implemented in an interactive Web application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming environment to support near-real time analysis along with 2- and 3-D visualizations. The approach is demonstrated using historical sampling data from an undulating vehicle deployed at three rivermouth sites in Lake Michigan during 2011. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of the interpolation averages approximately 10{\%} in 3-fold cross validation. The results show that the framework can be used to track river plume dynamics and provide insights on mixing, which could be related to wind and seiche events.},

@misc{Huffman1988,
abstract = {Abstract About 30{\%} of freezing precipitation cases are observed to occur in a subfreezing atmosphere (contrary to the classical melting ice model). We explain these cases with the concept of the “supercolled warm rain process” (SWRP): the warm rain process can yield liquid hydrometeors at subfreezing temperatures whenever too few ice nuclei are available to create solid hydrometeors. We find that all of the freezing precipitation cases in a subfreezing atmosphere show a rapid decrease of moisture content in the zone above the inferred cloud top (decreasing from liquid to ice saturation in lm than 20 mb), at temperatures ranging from 0° to −10°C. Additionally, this structure prevails among freezing cases (43{\%}) much more than among solid or liquid cases (10{\%} and 15{\%}, respectivelly). Regression experiments demonstrated that freezing precipitation was best described when (discretized) predictors were combined to describe particular physical processes, such as the SWRP. Besides the SWRP, the usual melting ice process variables, such as cold-layer size, and surface temperature are important for specifying freezing precipitation. The system handles liquid and solid precipitation adequately, but is deficient in specifying freezing cases. This last result is in agreement with previous studies, and reflects the small sample size due to the rarity of freezing cases.},

@article{Morin2003,
abstract = {Meteorological radar is a remote sensing system that provides rainfall estimations at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The radar-based rainfall intensities (R) are calculated from the observed radar reflectivities (Z). Often, rain gauge rainfall observations are used in combination with the radar data to find the optimal parameters in the Z–R transformation equation. The scale dependency of the power-law Z–R parameters when estimated from radar reflectivity and rain gauge intensity data is explored herein. The multiplicative (a) and exponent (b) parameters are said to be “scale dependent” if applying the observed and calculated rainfall intensities to objective function at different scale results in different “optimal” parameters. Radar and gauge data were analyzed from convective storms over a midsize, semiarid, and well-equipped watershed. Using the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) objective function, a significant scale dependency was observed. Increased time- and space scales resulted in a considerable increase of the a parameter and decrease of the b parameter. Two sources of uncertainties related to scale dependency were examined: 1) observational uncertainties, which were studied both experimentally and with simplified models that allow representation of observation errors; and 2) model uncertainties. It was found that observational errors are mainly (but not only) associated with positive bias of the b parameter that is reduced with integration, at least for small scales. Model errors also result in scale dependency, but the trend is less systematic, as in the case of observational errors. It is concluded that identification of optimal scale for Z–R relationship determination requires further knowledge of reflectivity and rain-intensity error structure.},

This influence is called a {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}directional bias{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}}. Different factors affecting the magnitude of directional bias are described. The relations between rainfall characteristics and the magnitude of the directional bias are shown for a conceptual catchment.The most important conclusion is that the maximal directional bias can theoretically reach values of several hundred percent, but this can happen only in a catchment with specially designed linear geometry. Maximal directional bias can be expected for storms moving downstream the catchment with velocity equal to the average flow velocity. Maximal directional bias occurs for storms with short duration giving low peak discharge, which are not important for design purposes.},

In this flash flooding regime, common practices for risk mitigation involve hydraulic modeling, geomorphic, and hydrologic analysis. However, apart from examining the intrinsic characteristics of a basin, realistic flood hazard assessment requires good understanding of the role of climatic forcing. In this work, peak rainfall intensities, total storm accumulation, average intensity, and antecedent moisture conditions of the 52 most important storms in record, during the period from 1993 to 2008, in northeast Attica, in Greece, are examined to investigate whether there is a correlation between specific rainfall conditions and flood triggering in the area. For this purpose, precipitation data from a network of five rain gauges installed across the study area were collected and analyzed. Storms totals, average intensity, antecedent moisture conditions, and peak intensities variations were calculated and compared with local flooding history. Results showed that among these rainfall measures, only peak storm intensity presents a significant correlation with flood triggering, and a rainfall threshold above which flooding becomes highly probable can be defined.},

In this study, four widely used satellite-based precipitation products (3B42-V7, 3B42-RT, CMORPH and PERSIANN) are evaluated with respect to their performance in capturing the properties of HPEs over different basin scales. Evaluation is carried out over the Upper Adige river basin (Eastern Italian Alps) for an eight-year period (2003-2010).

@article{Ziv2006,
abstract = {This study attempts to find a linkage between the interannual variations of the rainfall measured in 12 stations spread over the northern half of Israel (the southern Levant) and atmospheric circulations ranging from regional to global scale. The analysis was done for the midwinter months, December–February, in which two-thirds of the annual rainfall occurs, during the years 1950–2002. The study is based on composite maps for extremely dry/wet seasons and on maps of correlation between atmospheric variables and the rainfall time series. Our results show that an upper-level trough extending from Eastern Europe toward the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) is closely linked with the seasonal rainfall over the study area. This is expressed by a correlation of −0.74 between the 500-hPa geopotential height at 32.5°N, 35°E and the rainfall. This trough has two effects on the southern Levant rainfall: one is the dynamics implied by the upper trough and the other is the cool advection over the EM imparted by the northwesterly flows induced by the trough. The latter presumably enhances the atmospheric instability when it sweeps over the warmer waters of the EM. The upper trough was found to be associated with three global factors: the polar stratospheric jets, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and the SST variations over the western tropical Pacific Ocean, represented by the ‘Pacific Warm Pool' index. The EM trough is accompanied by a ridge covering western Europe, so that cold and wet winters in the southern Levant coincide with warm and dry winters over western Europe and vice versa.

abstract = {The transformation of rainfall into runoff at a basin outlet is the combined effect of many hydrological processes, which occur at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, determining the scale of the combined hydrological response of the basin is still problematic and concepts for its definition are yet to be identified. In this paper high-resolution meteorological radar data are used for the determination of a characteristic temporal scale for the hydrological response of the basin - the 'response time scale' (Ts*). Ts* is defined as the time scale at which the pattern of the time-averaged radar rainfall hietograph is most similar to the pattern of the measured outlet runoff hydrograph. The existence of such similarity at a relatively stable time scale for a specific basin indicates that it is an intrinsic property of the basin and is related to its hydrological response. The identification of the response time scale is carried out by analysis of observations only, without assuming a specific rainfall-runoff model. Ts* is examined in four small basins (10-100 km2) in Israel. The spatial scale is assumed as the entire basin. For all analyzed basins a stable response time scale is identified. Relatively short time scales are found for the urban and arid basins (15-30 min), while for the rural basins longer time scale are identified (90-180 min). The issues of relationship between the response time scale and basin properties and modeling at the response time scale have yet to be determined. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models that are used to map air pollutant concentrations are not free of errors. A possible approach for improving the final concentration map is to interpolate the residuals of the initial model concentration estimates. Due to the possible spatial autocorrelation of the residuals of the initial model estimates, Bayesian inference schemes were suggested for this task, since they can correctly adjust the level of fitting of the residuals to the random measurement errors. However, the complexity of Bayesian methods often discourages their use. Here, we present an alternative and simpler approach, using a leave-one-out cross-validation to determine the optimal level of fitting of the residual correction. We show that the optimal correction level is related to the extent of the spatial autocorrelation of the cross-validated residuals. Namely, when the residuals are not autocorrelated residual correction is unnecessary, and if employed may actually degrade the quality of the final concentration map. Moreover, our approach enables to optimize the residual correction based on different target performance measures, with a possibly different optimal correction depending on the performance measure used. Hence, different target performance measures can be chosen to fit best the specific application of interest. The method is demonstrated using output of three different models used for estimating NOxand NO2concentrations over Israel. We show that our approach can be used as an exploratory step, for assessing the potential benefit of residual correction, and as a simple alternative to Bayesian schemes.},

abstract = {For large-scale catchment hydrology, the crucial importance of a good estimate of spatial rainfall variability is generally admitted. However, the assumption of uniform rainfall is still applied for small areas, whether they are studied as individual catchments or represent an elementary area in a distributed model. To investigate the validity of this assumption, an experiment was conducted in a small catchment (4.4 ha) in the semiarid USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Measurements were made with recording and non-recording raingages as well as vectopluviometers for a range of events during the 1990 monsoon season (July–September). Geostatistical analysis of the data indicated the presence of first-order drift with corresponding rainfall gradients ranging from 0.28 to 2.48 mm per 100 m with an average of 1.2 mm per 100 m. These gradients represent a 4–14{\%} variation of the mean rainfall depth over a 100 m distance. Given these observations, the assumption of spatial rainfall uniformity in this and similar convective environments at the small watershed scale of 5 ha appears to be invalid.},

The threshold-matched precipitation index and the TRMM-and-other-sources ‘‘best-estimate'' data (3B43) have also been compared with rain gauge data and with the TRMM PR rainfall product. In the 36- month climatological assessment of the satellite products at a grid spacing of 1.0?, continental Africa has been categorized into five distinct climatic regions: arid, semiarid, savanna, tropical wet, and the South Atlantic Ocean. Zonal mean analysis shows that TRMM PR has a large overestimation in the tropical-rain-forest region of Africa in December–January–February and in March–April–May. The bias is minimized in June–July–August and September–October–November. Bias is generally high for all algorithms in the dry seasons when rainfall is minimal but is less pronounced in the dry seasons of southern African climatic regions. In general, 3B43 has the closest agreement with rain gauge data. The derived standard errors of the algorithms in the climatic regions of Africa are used as a measure of reliability and show that quantitative climatological estimates of TRMM PR are reliable only in the wettest season of the northern savanna and southern semiarid regions when the mean precipitation is greater than 120 mm month?1 . The study also shows that TRMM PR has the closest agreement with 3B43 over the South Atlantic Ocean.

abstract = {Flash floods cause some of the most severe natural disasters in Europe but Mediterranean areas are especially vulnerable. They can cause devastating damage to property, infrastructures and loss of human life. The complexity of flash flood generation processes and their dependency on different factors related to watershed properties and rainfall characteristics make flash flood prediction a difficult task. In this study, as part of the EU-FLASH project, we used an uncalibrated hydrological model to simulate flow events in a 27km2 Mediterranean watershed in Israel to analyze and better understand the various factors influencing flows. The model is based on the well-known SCS curve number method for rainfall-runoff calculations and on the kinematic wave method for flow routing. Existing data available from maps, GIS and field studies were used to define model parameters, and no further calibration was conducted to obtain a better fit between computed and observed flow data. The model rainfall input was obtained from the high temporal and spatial resolution radar data adjusted to rain gauges. Twenty flow events that occurred within the study area over a 15year period were analyzed. The model shows a generally good capability in predicting flash flood peak discharge in terms of their general level, classified as low, medium or high (all high level events were correctly predicted). It was found that the model mainly well predicts flash floods generated by intense, short-lived convective storm events while model performances for low and moderate flows generated by more widespread winter storms were quite poor. The degree of urban development was found to have a large impact on runoff amount and peak discharge, with higher sensitivity of moderate and low flow events relative to high flows. Flash flood generation was also found to be very sensitive to the temporal distribution of rain intensity within a specific storm event. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The emergence of low-cost, user-friendly and very compact air pollution platforms enable observations at high spatial resolution in near-real-time and provide new opportunities to simultaneously enhance existing monitoring systems, as well as engage citizens in active environmental monitoring. This provides a whole new set of capabilities in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. However, the data generated by these platforms are often of questionable quality. We have conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 24 identical units of a commercial low-cost sensor platform against CEN (European Standardization Organization) reference analyzers, evaluating their measurement capability over time and a range of environmental conditions. Our results show that their performance varies spatially and temporally, as it depends on the atmospheric composition and the meteorological conditions. Our results show that the performance varies from unit to unit, which makes it necessary to examine the data quality of each node before its use. In general, guidance is lacking on how to test such sensor nodes and ensure adequate performance prior to marketing these platforms. We have implemented and tested diverse metrics in order to assess if the sensor can be employed for applications that require high accuracy (i.e., to meet the Data Quality Objectives defined in air quality legislation, epidemiological studies) or lower accuracy (i.e., to represent the pollution level on a coarse scale, for purposes such as awareness raising). Data quality is a pertinent concern, especially in citizen science applications, where citizens are collecting and interpreting the data. In general, while low-cost platforms present low accuracy for regulatory or health purposes they can provide relative and aggregated information about the observed air quality.},

This is$\backslash$nachieved by matching raingage intensities to radar reflectivities taken$\backslash$nonly from small `'windows'' centered about the gauges in time and space.$\backslash$nThe windows must be small enough for the gauge to represent the rainfall$\backslash$ndepth within the radar window yet large enough to encompass the timing$\backslash$nand geometrical errors inherent to such coincident observations. The$\backslash$ncalculation of the Z(e)-R relation with the window probability matching$\backslash$nmethod (WPMM) is quite straightforward, whereby the unconditional$\backslash$ncumulative probabilities of Z(e) and R, which are obtained from all of$\backslash$nthe windows, are matched. In practice Z(e) and R, having the same$\backslash$ncumulative percentile, are related to each other.$\backslash$nA relatively small sample size (about 600 mm for all gauges combined) is$\backslash$nrequired to achieve a stable Z(e)-R relation with a standard deviation$\backslash$nof 15{\%} of R for a given Z(e).

abstract = {Accurate evaluation of air pollution on human-wellbeing requires high-resolution measurements. Standard air quality monitoring stations provide accurate pollution levels but due to their sparse distribution they cannot capture the highly resolved spatial variations within cities. Similarly, dedicated field campaigns can use tens of measurement devices and obtain highly dense spatial coverage but normally deployment has been limited to short periods of no more than few weeks. Nowadays, advances in communication and sensory technologies enable the deployment of dense grids of wireless distributed air monitoring nodes, yet their sensor ability to capture the spatiotemporal pollutant variability at the sub-neighborhood scale has never been thoroughly tested. This study reports ambient measurements of gaseous air pollutants by a network of six wireless multi-sensor miniature nodes that have been deployed in three urban sites, about 150. m apart. We demonstrate the network's capability to capture spatiotemporal concentration variations at an exceptional fine resolution but highlight the need for a frequent in-situ calibration to maintain the consistency of some sensors. Accordingly, a procedure for a field calibration is proposed and shown to improve the system's performance. Overall, our results support the compatibility of wireless distributed sensor networks for measuring urban air pollution at a sub-neighborhood spatial resolution, which suits the requirement for highly spatiotemporal resolved measurements at the breathing-height when assessing exposure to urban air pollution.},

Model performance was tested for one, two and three day forecasting lead times, measured by fractional standard error, the coefficient of determination, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency, multiplicative bias, probability of detection and false alarm rate. SVR based models performed best overall, but no one model outperformed the others in more than one watershed, suggesting that some models may be more suitable for certain types of data. Overall model performance varied greatly between climate regimes, suggesting that higher persistence and slower hydrological processes (i.e. snowmelt, glacial runoff, and subsurface flow) support reliable forecasting using daily and multi-day lead times.},

abstract = {This study presents a method for detecting contamination events of sources of drinking water based on the Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. The detection method has the purpose of protecting water supply systems against accidental and intentional contamination events. This purpose is achieved by first predicting future water-quality parameters using an autoregressive (AR) model. The AR model predicts future water-quality parameters using recent measurements of these parameters made with automated (on-line) water-quality sensors. Next, a probabilistic method assigns probabilities to the time series of residuals formed by comparing predicted water-quality parameters with threshold values. Finally, the D-S fusion method searches for anomalous probabilities of the residuals and uses the result of that search to determine whether the current water quality is normal (that is, free of pollution) or contaminated. The D-S fusion method is extended and improved in this paper by weighted averaging of water-contamination evidence and by the analysis of the persistence of anomalous probabilities of water-quality parameters. The extended D-S fusion method makes determinations that have a high probability of being correct concerning whether or not a source of drinking water has been contaminated. This paper's method for detecting water-contamination events was tested with water-quality time series from automated (on-line) water quality sensors. In addition, a small-scale, experimental, water-pipe network was tested to detect water-contamination events. The two tests demonstrated that the extended D-S fusion method achieves a low false alarm rate and high probabilities of detecting water contamination events.},

abstract = {Spatially detailed estimation of exposure to air pollutants in the urban environment is needed for many air pollution epidemiological studies. To benefit studies of acute effects of air pollution such exposure maps are required at high temporal resolution. This study introduces nonlinear optimisation framework that produces high resolution spatiotemporal exposure maps. An extensive traffic model output, serving as proxy for traffic emissions, is fitted via a nonlinear model embodying basic dispersion properties, to high temporal resolution routine observations of traffic-related air pollutant. An optimisation problem is formulated and solved at each time point to recover the unknown model parameters. These parameters are then used to produce a detailed concentration map of the pollutant for the whole area covered by the traffic model. Repeating the process for multiple time points results in the spatiotemporal concentration field. The exposure at any location and for any span of time can then be computed by temporal integration of the concentration time series at selected receptor locations for the durations of desired periods. The methodology is demonstrated for NO2exposure using the output of a traffic model for the greater Tel Aviv area, Israel, and the half-hourly monitoring and meteorological data from the local air quality network. A leave-one-out cross-validation resulted in simulated half-hourly concentrations that are almost unbiased compared to the observations, with a mean error (ME) of 5.2ppb, normalised mean error (NME) of 32{\%}, 78{\%} of the simulated values are within a factor of two (FAC2) of the observations, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.6. The whole study period integrated exposure estimations are also unbiased compared with their corresponding observations, with ME of 2.5ppb, NME of 18{\%}, FAC2 of 100{\%} and R2that equals 0.62. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean climate together with the type of urban setting found in mountainous Middle Eastern cities generate much lower runoff yields than previously reported and than usually estimated for urban design. In fact, a close analysis shows that most of the rainwater remains within the cities as a possible source for urban groundwater recharge. The present study examined two locales – Ramallah, an old traditional Palestinian Arab town, and Modiin, a new township in Israel – both situated on the karstic Yarkon Taninim aquifer. This aquifer supplies the only high-quality drinking water in the region (one quarter of the Israeli-Palestinian water demand), which is characterized by dense populations and limited water resources.$\backslash$n This paper provides the first measured information on the hydrological effects of urbanization in the area. It was found that the shift of the mountainous natural steep slopes into a series of closed-terraces with homes and gardens create areas that are disconnected from the urban runoff response. Roofs drained into the attached gardens create favorable recharge units. Mainly low-gradient roads became the principal source for urban runoff already following 1–4 mm of rainfall. Parallel roads converted single peak hydrographs towards multi-peak runoff responses, increasing flow duration and reducing peak discharges. The remaining urban area (public parks, natural areas, etc.) generated runoff only as a result of high-magnitude rainstorms. All of the above conditions limited urban runoff coefficients to an upper boundary of only 35{\%} and 30{\%} (Ramallah and Modiin, respectively). During extreme rainstorms (above 100 mm) similar runoff coefficients were measured in urban and natural catchments as a result of the limited areas contributing to runoff in the urban areas, while natural terrain does not have these artificial limits. Hence, the effects of urbanization decrease with event magnitude and there is significant potential for urban groundwater recharge. However, frequent low-magnitude rainstorms often generate highly polluted stormwater in urban sewer systems and this water should only be used with great caution.},

abstract = {This paper describes a set of spatial rainfall statistics (termed "spatial moments of catchment rainfall") quantifying the dependence existing between spatial rainfall organisation, basin morphology and runoff response. These statistics describe the spatial rainfall organisation in terms of concentration and dispersion statistics as a function of the distance measured along the flow routing coordinate. The introduction of these statistics permits derivation of a simple relationship for the quantification of catchment-scale storm velocity. The concept of the catchment-scale storm velocity takes into account the role of relative catchment orientation and morphology with respect to storm motion and kinematics. The paper illustrates the derivation of the statistics from an analytical framework recently proposed in literature and explains the conceptual meaning of the statistics by applying them to five extreme flash floods occurred in various European regions in the period 2002-2007. High resolution radar rainfall fields and a distributed hydrologic model are employed to examine how effective are these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organisation which is important for runoff modelling. This is obtained by quantifying the effects of neglecting the spatial rainfall variability on flood modelling, with a focus on runoff timing. The size of the study catchments ranges between 36 to 982 km(2). The analysis reported here shows that the spatial moments of catchment rainfall can be effectively employed to isolate and describe the features of rainfall spatial organization which have significant impact on runoff simulation. These statistics provide useful information on what space-time scales rainfall has to be monitored, given certain catchment and flood characteristics, and what are the effects of space-time aggregation on flood response modeling.},

The combination of the basin physical characteristics (steep slopes, sparse vegetation, thin soils and permeable rock) and intense, heavy and irregularly distributed rain, generates flash floods. Runoff generation is sudden, giving rise to flash floods with sharp, narrow hydrographs with short time lags. The high amount of runoff is, nevertheless, only a small fraction of the total rainfall, since the characteristics of the river basins are such that infiltration of large amounts of water occurs. Using daily hydrological data from the Rambla de la Viuda basin and 5-min data from both the Barranc del Carraixet and the Rambla de Poyo basins, the rainfall-runoff processes have been analysed during flood events in these ephemeral streams. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The WSR-88D Precipitation Processing Subsystem (PPS) represents the first attempt at network-wide operational radar-estimated precipitation in the United States. The system brings a dramatic advancement to operational flood forecasting when compared to earlier radars and rain gage networks. Nevertheless, the system suffers from significant limitations inherent to the use of radar to estimate precipitation. These limitations have persisted despite nearly fifty years of research in the field. Much of the problem has been ascribed to the complex nonlinear relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate at the surface. This relationship has been expressed empirically ("Z-R" power law) and many different ones have resulted from various experiments. Following suit, the WSR-88D software allows a change to the Z-R relationship for differing precipitation situations. A review of recent literature, however, reveals that the choice of an appropriate Z-R relationship is not the dominant issue in radar precipitation estimation, as was once widely believed. There are many precipitation estimation errors from radar, and they can often be larger than Z-R irrepresentativeness. These errors are briefly explored as they relate to the WSR-88D. It appears that overshooting of precipitation by the radar beam often produces the largest errors, usually causing precipitation underestimation. This is especially so at long ranges ({\textgreater} 60 nm), but can also occur at short ranges ({\textless} 30 nm) because of the beam elevations used by the PPS. Overshoot is more pronounced in the cool season. Inadequate calibration of WSR-88D network radars also appears to contribute large errors. Potential remedies for the major errors are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability to the WSR-88D. Recommendations for implementation or further study are made based on this applicability.},

abstract = {High-resolution space-time stochastic models for precipitation are crucial for hydrological applications related to flood risk and water resources management. In this study, we present a new stochastic space-time model, STREAP, which is capable of reproducing essential features of the statistical structure of precipitation in space and time for a wide range of scales, and at the same time can be used for continuous simulation. The model is based on a three-stage hierarchical structure that mimics the precipitation formation process. The stages describe the storm arrival process, the temporal evolution of areal mean precipitation intensity and wet area, and the evolution in time of the two-dimensional storm structure. Each stage of the model is based on appropriate stochastic modeling techniques spanning from point processes, multivariate stochastic simulation and random fields. Details of the calibration and simulation procedures in each stage are provided so that they can be easily reproduced. STREAP is applied to a case study in Switzerland using 7 years of high-resolution (2 × 2 km2; 5 min) data from weather radars. The model is also compared with a popular parsimonious space-time stochastic model based on point processes (space-time Neyman-Scott) which it outperforms mainly because of a better description of spatial precipitation. The model validation and comparison is based on an extensive evaluation of both areal and point scale statistics at hydrologically relevant temporal scales, focusing mainly on the reproduction of the probability distributions of rainfall intensities, correlation structure, and the reproduction of intermittency and wet spell duration statistics. The results shows that a more accurate description of the space-time structure of precipitation fields in stochastic models such as STREAP does indeed lead to a better performance for properties and at scales which are not used in model calibration.},

We hypothesize that the number of larvae that show advanced trajectories in a group corresponds with water contamination, as the latter triggers avoidance behavior in the organisms. The proportion of advanced trajectories in the control and treated groups during the first minute of darkness was designated as a segregation parameter. It was parametrized and a threshold value was set using one CdCl2 trial and then applied to the remaining CdCl2 and permethrin replicates. For all cases, the method allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically significantly different between the treated and control groups, except for the lowest CdCl2 concentration (0.625 mg/L) in one replicate.

The lumped approach is compared with two types of semidistributed approaches to assess the relative importance of rainfall and parameter distribution on modeling results. In order to base these comparisons on a large number of definitely heterogeneous basins, we introduce chimera watersheds. Chimera watersheds associate two actual watersheds of similar size to constitute a third, highly heterogeneous virtual basin, where the knowledge of spatialized flows makes it possible to test disaggregated approaches and to compare them to the lumped approach. We show that the greatest portion (two thirds) of improvement contributed by spatial distribution comes from accounting for rainfall variability. If spatial distribution is considered to be a useful direction leading to improving the reliability of hydrological models, we believe that efforts should be directed first and foremost toward the use of spatially distributed rainfall data and only secondary to the disaggregation of watershed (land-surface) parameters.},

abstract = {Flood frequency curves are presented for five regions in the western USA characterized by diverse climate but similar physiography. The regional curves are obtained via an index flood method based on probability-weighted moments of the generalized extreme value distribution. The curves differ markedly in their slopes, reflecting differences in mechanisms that produce floods. The Foothills region of Colorado is typical of semi-arid areas where floods are produced by intense thunderstorms. In this region, the 100-year flood may be more than ten times the mean annual flood. The Alpine region of Colorado is typical of areas where runoff is generated by snowmelt. In this region, the 100-year flood is less than two times the mean annual flood. The Sierra Nevada, Coast Range and Klamath Mountain regions of California typify areas where floods are produced by large-scale frontal storms. In these regions, the 100-year flood may be three to six times the mean annual flood. In all regions the mean annual flood is most highly correlated with drainage area and mean annual precipitation. No correlation is found between the standard deviation of annual maxima and various measures of basin physiography or drainage area. It is suggested that the variation in flood frequency distributions reflects largely the variability in precipitation amount and intensity rather than differences in physiography. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Flood simulation studies use spatial-temporal rainfall data input into distributed hydrological models. A correct description of rainfall in space and in time contributes to improvements on hydrological modelling and design. This work is focused on the analysis of 2-D convective structures (rain cells), whose contribution is especially significant in most flood events. The objective of this paper is to provide statistical descriptors and distribution functions for convective structure characteristics of precipitation systems producing floods in Catalonia (NE Spain). To achieve this purpose heavy rainfall events recorded between 1996 and 2000 have been analysed. By means of weather radar, and applying 2-D radar algorithms a distinction between convective and stratiform precipitation is made. These data are introduced and analyzed with a GIS. In a first step different groups of connected pixels with convective precipitation are identified. Only convective structures with an area greater than 32 km 2 are selected. Then, geometric characteristics (area, perimeter, orientation and dimensions of the ellipse), and rainfall statistics (maximum, mean, minimum, range, standard deviation, and sum) of these structures are obtained and stored in a database. Finally, descriptive statistics for selected characteristics are calculated and statistical distributions are fitted to the observed frequency distributions. Statistical analyses reveal that the Generalized Pareto distribution for the area and the Generalized Extreme Value distribution for the perimeter, dimensions, orientation and mean areal precipitation are the statistical distributions that best fit the observed ones of these parameters. The statistical descriptors and the probability distribution functions obtained are of direct use as an input in spatial rainfall generators.},

abstract = {A hybrid parallel scheme for the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) suitable for parallel assimilation of multi-scale observations including those from dense observational networks such as those of radar is developed based on the domain decomposition strategy. The scheme handles inter-node communication through message passing interface (MPI), and the communication within shared-memory nodes via Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) threads; it also supports pure MPI and pure OpenMP modes. The parallel framework can accommodate high-volume remotesensed radar (or satellite) observations as well as conventional observations that usually have larger covariance localization radii. The performance of the parallel algorithm has been tested with simulated and real radar data. The parallel program shows good scalability in pure MPI and hybrid MPI/OpenMP modes, while pure OpenMP runs exhibit limited scalability on a symmetric shared-memory system. It is found that in MPI mode, better parallel performance is achieved with domain decomposition configurations in which the leading dimension of the state variable arrays is larger, because this configuration allows for more efficient memory access. Given a fixed amount of computing},

abstract = {Precipitation and convective storms now- casting based on weather radar data has been studied in the CHMI (Czech Hydrometeorological Institute) for a long period. Two methods of radar echo prediction on entire radar domain were implemented in 2003 into the operational processing of the CzechWeather Radar Net- work. The methods work very well but they have some limitations mainly for severe convective storms nowcast- ing. These limitations resulted into development of cell- oriented algorithm of radar echo prediction. Cell identification is based on single minimum thresh- olding of maximum reflectivity data. Wind field from operational prediction algorithm (calculated for entire radar domain) is used as a first guess of cell assignment algorithm in subsequent images. Splitting and merging are also considered within the cell assignment algorithm. Simple calculation of cell motion vector from reflectiv- ity core centres displacement is too inaccurate. Thus, to calculate cell motion vector, special local similarity algorithm is applied on each assigned cell pair. The paper describes this algorithm and shows evalu- ation of the algorithm performance. Comparison with operationally implemented algorithm is showed.},

abstract = {As a response to climate change, shifting rainfall trends including increased multi-year droughts and an escalation in extreme rainfall events are expected in the Middle East. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of these shifting trends on stream flow in the Jordan River and its tributaries. We use a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model to generate artificial daily rainfall simulations which capture independently shifting trends of increased droughts and escalated extreme. These simulations are then used as input into a hydrological model calibrated for the upper catchments of the Jordan River to compare the impact on stream flow and water resources between the different rainfall scenarios. We compare the predicted baseflow and surface flow components of the tested watersheds, and find that while an increase in extreme rainfall events increases the intensity and frequency of surface flow, the over all flow to the Jordan River, and the characteristics of the baseflow in the Jordan River system is not largely impacted. In addition, though it has been suggested that in the case of a multi-year drought the karstic nature of the aquifer might lead to more intense, non-linear reductions in stream flow, here we quantify and show the conditions when annual stream flow reduce linearly with rainfall, and when these relations will become non-linear. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our contributions are three-fold: we architect, prototype, and compare multiple hardware devices and software applications for collecting urban air pollution data with high spatial density in real-time; we develop web-based tools and mobile apps for the visualization and estimation of air pollution exposure customized to individuals; and we conduct field trials to validate our system and demonstrate that it yields much more accurate exposure estimates than current systems. We believe our system can increase user engagement in exposure management, and better inform medical studies linking air pollution with human health.},

abstract = {Recent developments in sensory and communication technologies have made the development of portable air-quality (AQ) micro-sensing units (MSUs) feasible. These MSUs allow AQ measurements in many new applications, such as ambulatory exposure analyses and citizen science. Typically, the performance of these devices is assessed using the mean error or correlation coefficients with respect to a laboratory equipment. However, these criteria do not represent how such sensors perform outside of laboratory conditions in large-scale field applications, and do not cover all aspects of possible differences in performance between the sensor-based and standardized equipment, or changes in performance over time. This paper presents a comprehensive Sensor Evaluation Toolbox (SET) for evaluating AQ MSUs by a range of criteria, to better assess their performance in varied applications and environments. Within the SET are included four new schemes for evaluating sensors' capability to: locate pollution sources; represent the pollution level on a coarse scale; capture the high temporal variability of the observed pollutant and their reliability. Each of the evaluation criteria allows for assessing sensors' performance in a different way, together constituting a holistic evaluation of the suitability and usability of the sensors in a wide range of applications. Application of the SET on measurements acquired by 25 MSUs deployed in eight cities across Europe showed that the suggested schemes facilitates a comprehensive cross platform analysis that can be used to determine and compare the sensors' performance. The SET was implemented in R and the code is available on the first author's website.},

abstract = {Dewfall can be a substantial water resource crucial for maintaining water balance in desert ecosystems such as the hyper-arid zone of the Taklimakan Desert in China. However, little is known about the formation, quantitative characteristics, and factors influencing dewfall in this region. This study elucidates dew formation and its long-term trend in this region using observational data, including flux, meteorological, and soil water content data obtained using the Eddy covariance system and those recorded by a weather station in the area. The results are as follows: (1) Dew forms in the Populus forest, with nighttime dewfall duration being about 2. h. The average daily dewfall amount during the observation period (June 4-October 24, 2011) was 0.12. mm. The number of dewfall days was 104. days (73{\%} of total days), and the cumulative dewfall amount was 12.87. mm. (2) The dewfall days and amounts on the canopy and soil surfaces were 86. days and 8.64. mm, and 38. days and 4.23. mm, respectively. The top soil can absorb more water vapor than condensed dew. (3) At different time scales (half-hour, day, and half-year), obvious variations in dewfall duration, dewfall amounts, and meteorological factors occurred. (4) Over the past 51. years, changes in the number of dewfall days during the summer (June-October) exhibited a trend similar to that of changes in total dewfall amount during the same period. The average dewfall amount during the summer half-year was 17.2. mm, which is about 64{\%} of the summer half-year rainfall and 50{\%} of the annual rainfall. In particular, the total dewfall amount was higher than the annual rainfall amount during the one-fifth of the past 51. years. The study proved dewfall is one of important water resources in the arid Taklimakan Desert region, and it also significantly influenced the water balance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Each data set was "spiked" with simulated anomalous water quality values of I h duration and 10 levels of spike strength. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is proposed as an objective means of assessing and comparing water quality change-detection algorithm results that is also able to provide the tradeoff between missed detections and false alarms on a single plot. The area under the ROC curve provides a measure of the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm for each spike strength and location. Resulting areas under the ROC curve range from 0.46 for spike strengths of 1.0 (background) to 0.98 for strengths of 3.5 standard deviations from the mean, where an ROC curve area of 1.0 indicates perfect detection.},

abstract = {Although much is known about the meteorological conditions for significant aircraft icing, research studies to date have only been successful identifying conditions for general icing, i.e. clouds in the temperature range from 0??C to about -20??C. The aerodynamics of ice accumulation suggest three meteorological factors, cloud liquid water, droplet size, and air temperature. Only the latter is known or forecast with a significant degree of accuracy. The first two are partial functions of the atmosphere's vertical motion which is poorly known, especially in convective situations. However, favorable patterns of relative humidity and potential instability that indicate conditions for possible convection are readily discernable from sounding or numerical forecast model data. Two neural networks were taught to sort out these patterns with respect to icing intensity. Each uses a different neuron transfer function which gives each a "personality". The "conservative" network diagnoses light icing well but has difficulty with moderate or greater icing. On the other hand, the "radical" network finds the higher intensity icing but is not as good at lower intensities. By combining the strengths of each, NNICE makes skillful icing forecasts of all intensities.},

The emphasis is on the concepts upon which the methodology is based. A “storm” is defined as a contiguous region exceeding thresholds for reflectivity and size. Storms defined in this way are identified at discrete time intervals. An optimization scheme is employed to match the storms at one time with those at the following time, with some geometric logic to deal with mergers and splits. The short-term forecast of both position and size is based on a weighted linear fit to the storm track history data.

abstract = {Severe storms and associated floods have been a major natural catastrophe in a number of cities over the last decade. The risk of extreme precipitation events is usually assessed by return periods, which are evaluated from frequency analysis of point rainfall accumulations. Point return periods associated with design quantiles are traditionally used in the design of structures to control storm runoff and floods. Return periods have also acquired great meaning in hydrology when analyzing observed events and qualifying their severity. This study investigates the characterization of the return period of a rainfall event over a given area, highlighting the importance of considering its spatial dimension. Three storm events observed in the city of Marseilles, France, are studied. Severity graphs and severity diagrams are developed for each storm event. They allow us to visualize the strong variability of return periods within a storm. For a given rainfall duration, one can observe point return period estimations varying from ordinary values (less than 1 or 2 years) to rare or even exceptional values (10-100 years) when considering different rain gauges. Also, for a given rain gauge, different return periods are estimated for different rainfall durations and important differences can be found between the obtained values. The degree of severity of each storm event for the city is shown to depend also on the extent of heavy rain areas and therefore on the spatial structure of rainfall intensities. Storm severity visualization could be useful in evaluating the importance of observed rainstorms over a city and in helping decision makers in real time water management.},

abstract = {Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors are promising tools for supplementing existing air quality monitoring networks. However, the performance of the new generation of low-cost PM sensors under field conditions is not well understood. In this study, we characterized the performance capabilities of a new low-cost PM sensor model (Plantower model PMS3003) for measuring PM2.5 at 1 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h integration times. We tested the PMS3003s in both low concentration suburban regions (Durham and Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC, US) with 1 h PM2.5 (mean ± Std.Dev) 15 of 9 ± 9 µg m -3 and 10 ± 3 µg m -3 respectively, and a high concentration urban location (Kanpur, India) with 1 h PM2.5 of 36 ± 17 µg m -3 and 116 ± 57 µg m -3 during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. In Durham and Kanpur, the sensors were compared to a research-grade instrument (environmental b-attenuation monitor (E-BAM)) to determine how these sensors perform across a range of PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological factors (e.g., temperature and relative humidity (RH)). In RTP, the sensors were compared to three Federal Equivalent Methods (FEMs) including two Teledyne 20 Model T640s and a ThermoScientific Model 5030 SHARP to demonstrate the importance of the type of reference monitor selected for sensor calibration. The decrease of 1 h mean errors of the calibrated sensors using univariate linear models from Durham (201{\%}) to Kanpur monsoon (46{\%}) and to post-monsoon (35{\%}) season showed that PMS3003 performance generally improved as ambient PM2.5 increased. The precision of reference instruments (T640: ±0.5 µg m -3 for 1 h; SHARP: ±2 µg m -3 for 24 h, better than the E-BAM) is critical in evaluating sensor performance and b-attenuation-based monitors 25 may not be ideal for testing PM sensors at low concentrations, as underscored by 1) the less dramatic error reduction over averaging times in RTP against optical-based T640 (from 27{\%} for 1 h to 9{\%} for 24 h) than in Durham (from 201{\%} to 15{\%}); 2) the lower errors in RTP than Kanpur post-monsoon season (from 35{\%} to 11{\%}); 3) the higher T640–PMS3003s correlations (R 2 ³ 0.63) than SHARP–PMS3003s (R 2 ³ 0.25). A major RH influence was found in RTP (1 h RH = 64 ± 22{\%}) due to the relatively high precision of the T640 measurements that can explain up to {\~{}}30{\%} of the variance in 1 min to 6 h 30 PMS3003 PM2.5 measurements. When proper RH corrections are made by empirical non-linear equations after using a more precise reference method to calibrate the sensors, our work suggests that the PMS3003s can measure PM2.5 concentrations within {\~{}}10{\%} of ambient values.

abstract = {The HEC-HMS and IHACRES rainfall runoff models were applied to simulate a single streamflow event in Wadi Dhuliel arid catchment that occurred on 30-31/01/2008. Streamflow estimation was performed on the basis of an hourly scale. The aim of this study was to develop a new framework of rainfall-runoff model applications in arid catchments by integrating a re-adjusted satellite-derived rainfall dataset (GSMaP{\_}MVK+) to determine the location of the rainfall storm. The HEC-HMS model was applied using the HEC-GeoHMS extension in ArcView 3. 3 while the IHACRES is Java-based version model. The HEC-HMS model input data include soil type, land use/land cover, and slope. By contrast, the lumped model IHACRES was also applied, based on hourly rainfall and temperature data. Both models were calibrated and validated using the observed streamflow data set collected at Al-Za'atari discharge station. The performance of IHACRES showed some weaknesses, while the flow comparison between the calibrated streamflow results fits well with the observed streamflow data in HEC-HMS. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ef) for the two models was 0. 51 and 0. 88 respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The method utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) for studying the interplay between multivariate water quality parameters and detecting possible outliers. The analysis is followed by updating the probability of an event, initially assumed rare, by recursively applying Bayes' rule. The model is assessed through correlation coefficient (R(2)), mean squared error (MSE), confusion matrices, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and true and false positive rates (TPR and FPR). The product of the suggested methodology consists of alarms indicating a possible contamination event based on single and multiple water quality parameters. The methodology was developed and tested on real data attained from a water utility.},

@article{Ragab2003,
abstract = {Lack of accurate data has led some hydrologists and city planners to assume that urban infiltration is zero and runoff is 100{\%} of the rainfall. These assumptions lead to an over estimation of road runoff volume and an underestimation of direct recharge to groundwater, which is already rising under some UK cities. This study investigates in filtration and runoff processes and quantifies the percentage of rainfall that contributes to storm drainage, and that which infiltrates through different types of road surface. Access tubes were installed for measuring soil water content using a neutron probe in three car parks, a road and a grass site at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Crowmarsh Gifford, Wallingford. Storm drainage was recorded at the exit of the Thamesmead Estate in Crowmarsh Gifford, just before the drain joins the River Thames at Wallingford. Rainfall and water table depth were also recorded. Weekly measurements of soil moisture content indicated that the top 40 cm layer is not influenced by water-table fluctuations and, therefore, positive changes in soil moisture could be attributed to infiltration of rainfall through the surface. Depending on the nature of the surface, subsurface layers, level of traffic, etc., between 6 and 9{\%} of rainfall was found to infiltrate through the road surfaces studied. The storm drainage generated by road runoff revealed a flow pattern similar to that of the receiving watercourse (River Thames) and increased with the increase of infiltration and soil water content below the road surface. The ratio of runoff to rainfall was 0.7, 0.9 and 0.5 for annual, winter (October-March) and summer (April-September) respectively. As the results of the infiltration indicated that 6 to 9{\%} of annual rainfall infiltrates through the road surface, this means that evaporation represents, 21-24{\%} of annual rainfall, with more evaporation taking place during summer than winter.

abstract = {A system for monitoring and forecasting urban air pollution is presented in this paper. The system uses low-cost air-quality monitoring motes that are equipped with an array of gaseous and meteorological sensors. These motes wirelessly communicate to an intelligent sensing platform that consists of several modules. The modules are responsible for receiving and storing the data, preprocessing and converting the data into useful information, forecasting the pollutants based on historical information, and finally presenting the acquired information through different channels, such as mobile application, Web portal, and short message service. The focus of this paper is on the monitoring system and its forecasting module. Three machine learning (ML) algorithms are investigated to build accurate forecasting models for one-step and multi-step ahead of concentrations of ground-level ozone (O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), nitrogen dioxide (NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), and sulfur dioxide (SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}). These ML algorithms are support vector machines, M5P model trees, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Two types of modeling are pursued: 1) univariate and 2) multivariate. The performance evaluation measures used are prediction trend accuracy and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that using different features in multivariate modeling with M5P algorithm yields the best forecasting performances. For example, using M5P, RMSE is at its lowest, reaching 31.4, when hydrogen sulfide (H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}S) is used to predict SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. Contrarily, the worst performance, i.e., RMSE of 62.4, for SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is when using ANN in univariate modeling. The outcome of this paper can be significantly useful for alarming applications in areas with high air pollution levels.},

abstract = {Metropolitan air pollution is a growing concern in both developing and developed countries. Fixed-station monitors, typically operated by governments, offer accurate but sparse data, and are increasingly being augmented by lower fidelity but denser measurements taken by mobile sensors carried by concerned citizens and researchers. In this paper, we introduce HazeEst—a machine learning model that combines sparse fixed-station data with dense mobile sensor data to estimate the air pollution surface for any given hour on any given day in Sydney. We assess our system using seven regression models and tenfold cross validation. The results show that estimation accuracy of support vector regression (SVR) is similar to decision tree regression and random forest regression, and higher than extreme gradient boosting, multi-layer perceptrons, linear regression, and adaptive boosting regression. The air pollution estimates from our models are validated via field trials, and results show that SVR not only yields high spatial resolution estimates that correspond well with the pollution surface obtained from fixed and mobile sensor monitoring systems, but also indicates boundaries of polluted area better than other regression models. Our results can be visualized using a Web-based application customized for metropolitan Sydney. We believe that the continuous estimates provided by our system can better inform air pollution exposure and its impact on human health.},

The paper discusses spatial runoff and annual streamflow characteristics, flow duration and baseflow index (BFI) analyses, annual flood frequency analysis and flood transmission losses, a water balance study, wet and dry run length analysis and, finally, yield from hypothetical reservoirs located across the LEB. There are 12 conclusions listed at the end of the paper. We identify two highlights as follows:•The coefficient of variation of annual flows, Cv, varies from 0.98 to 2.62. Compared with 45 arid zone rivers world-wide excluding Australian rivers, the annual Cv of the LEB streams are approximately double the average variability found world-wide.•Large transmission losses occur as flood flows move down the middle reaches of the major river systems. The transmission losses vary non-linearly with flood size as a result of differing transmission efficiencies between primary channels and the floodplain, and varying floodplain utilisation.},

However, reliably predicting these changes requires accurate knowledge of calcite reaction rates. While numerous studies have examined calcium carbonate dissolution rates, most have focused on pure calcite crystals rather than actual rocks. In this study, two types of flow-through experiments were carried out to determine the calcite dissolution rates in texturally diverse calcareous rocks: the first type of experiment had a duration of 3 days, while the second type ran for 3 months. Our experiments show that rocks with differing textures and roughness (samples included coarse-grained oolitic limestone, fine-grained Solnhofen limestone, marble and calcite spar) do in fact dissolve by different mechanisms. However, despite these differences, bulk reaction rates were found to be remarkably similar (with a relative standard deviation of {\textless}20{\%}) and consistent with previously reported reaction rates for calcite. Thus, our results suggest that textural differences between rock types are unlikely to have an important impact on overall reaction rates in fractured carbonate reservoirs.},

abstract = {Abstract Because of a lack of regular, direct measurements, limited information is available about the frequency and the spatial and temporal distribution of icing conditions aloft, including supercooled large drops (SLD). Research aircraft provide in situ observations of these conditions, but the sample set is small and can be biased. Surface observations of freezing fog and freezing precipitation provide additional insight, but cannot be used alone to assess the presence of icing aloft. Climatologies based solely on such observations can underestimate their presence in areas where subfreezing temperatures are uncommon. Other techniques can be used in an effort to reduce some of these biases and limitations. Expanding upon results for North America reported in Part I, the frequencies of icing and SLD over Europe and Asia are inferred here using 1) surface weather observations in conjunction with vertical profiles of temperature and moisture and 2) model reanalyses of temperature and moisture. Icing maxima and minima are found to migrate seasonally, both geographically and in the vertical, and to vary in their intensity. They are linked to the location of common storm tracks and other forcing, such as that associated with sloped terrain. After establishing reasonable consistency between the methods over data rich regions, the model analyses are used to examine icing frequencies over the remainder of the globe.},

The general spatial and temporal characteristics of these data are presented. Seasonality of catchment rainday occurrence is illustrated and gauge rainday occurrence shown to be strongly associated with elevation. Most point rainfalls are of 1-2 h duration, initiated in mid to late afternoon. Spatial distribution is highly localised so that for the minimum intergauge distances of 8-20 km, probability of joint occurrence and cross-correlation of hourly rainfall are small. On the basis of these data, a stochastic model of the spatial distribution of hourly rainfall has been formulated. Catchment and gauge rainday occurrence are well reproduced, as are point rainfall depths and durations. Spatial performance is reasonable for daily rainfall. However, the weak spatial dependence in the data leads to some clustering of occurrence at the hourly level, which the model is unable to reproduce. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {We introduce a long-term, high-resolution radar rainfall data set for the Baltimore metropolitan area covering the 10-yr period from 2000{\&}{\#}8211;2009. Rainfall fields are developed at 15 min time interval and 1 km horizontal resolution for a 17,000-km2 region centered on the Baltimore metropolitan area. The Hydro-NEXRAD system is used as a platform for generating radar rainfall fields. We utilize the high-resolution, 10-yr data set to characterize striking spatial heterogeneities in rainfall for the Baltimore metropolitan region, both in terms of mean rainfall and rainfall extremes. The role of complex terrain (associated with urbanization, the Chesapeake Bay, and mountainous terrain) in controlling spatial heterogeneities of rainfall climatology for the Baltimore study region is discussed. We also characterize the seasonal and diurnal variation of rainfall over the study region using the 10-yr rainfall data set, with particular focus on the diurnal variation of rainfall during the warm season. High-resolution rainfall fields are especially useful for examining the distribution of rainfall from a drainage basin perspective, as illustrated through analyses of basin-averaged rainfall rate for basins of contrasting drainage area and analyses of the duration of dry periods for small urban watersheds. Analyses and methodologies used to develop the long-term Baltimore rainfall data set are broadly applicable to other regions of the United States and in settings around the world with long-term, high-quality radar data sets.},

abstract = {Flash floods and debris flows develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems for rainfall, streamflow and sediment discharge are not able to monitor. Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.},

@article{Hasan2014,
abstract = {One of the key challenges in hydrology is to accurately measure and predict the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall. Rain gauges measuring at point locations are often considered as the "ground truth" for grid based radar rainfall calibration. Usually, no consideration is given to the uncertainty in the measurement that varies depending on the number of rain gauges that fall within each grid cell. If this uncertainty in the rain gauge network measurements is ignored, the Z-. R relationship used to convert reflectivity (. Z) to rainfall (. R) will be biased. We investigate the effects of point gauge rainfall uncertainty on parameter bias in the Z-. R relationship. An error model is developed to compute point gauge rainfall uncertainty at the radar grid resolution. This error model has two components: (1) the error in the gauge measurement itself, and (2) the error introduced by the gauge not capturing the spatial variability within a radar pixel. The Simulation Extrapolation method (SIMEX) is used to determine the extent of parameter bias present in the rainfall-reflectivity relationship as a result of this uncertainty. When considering the point gauge rainfall uncertainty a 4{\%} decrease in the average radar rainfall estimates is found.},

The analysis incorporates rainfall records from a network of 28 surface meteorological stations and information on the spatial distribution of the flash flood events that is derived from the active database of damaging weather events maintained by the atmospheric modelling group of the National Observatory of Athens. The main findings concern the relation between the flash flood impact, as measured by the Fire Service operations in flooded properties, and precipitation in various time intervals, as well as the possibility to define rainfall intensity thresholds for flood triggering at a more local level. It is shown that the quality of the produced thresholds depends on the distribution and density of the rain gauges that cover each specified geographical area of the Attica region.},

abstract = {The shape, timing and peak flow of a stream flow hydrograph are significantly influenced by spatial and temporal variability in rainfall and watershed characteristics. Depending upon the size and shape of a watershed, its hydrological response is closely linked with storm dynamics. On an urban watershed a rain storm moving in the direction of flow produces a higher peak than it would if it were moving in the opposite direction. The effect of storm speed on peak discharge is much less for rapidly moving storms than for storms moving at about the same speed as the flow velocity. In a relatively homogeneous watershed the most important effect of spatial variability of rainfall occurs in the timing and shape of the runoff hydrograph. Temporally variable rainfall leads to higher peak flow than does constant rainfall. Significant errors in the prediction of runoff occur when an equivalent uniform hillslope is used to represent a heterogeneous hillslope. When average soil properties are used instead of spatially variable properties, significant differences are observed in infiltration. Spatially variable roughness alters the flow dynamics significantly. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The Dead Sea (drainage area of ∼42,200 km2) is a terminal lake fed from the north by the Jordan River. The main water source into the Dead Sea is runoff, and its level is highly sensitive to the annual rainfall in the upper Jordan River drainage basin. Here, we summarize relevant data about present and past surface-water hydrology in the drainage basin and water input into the Dead Sea. The lower Jordan River, with a natural mean annual discharge of ∼1100 106 m3 yr−1, drains Mediterranean to semiarid areas in northern Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Additional water is contributed from tributaries such as the Zarqa River (64 106 m3 yr−1). The diversion of water from these and other sources since the 1960s to an inflow of only ∼210 106 m3 yr−1 caused a 20 m decline of the Dead Sea level. The ephemeral Nahal Arava drains hyperarid areas south of the Dead Sea and contributes small volumes of water (∼5 106 m3 yr−1) but experiences occasional large floods (up to 1000 m3 s−1); the smaller, steep ephemeral tributaries west of the Dead Sea produce relatively large floods (up to 775 m3 s−1) due to their wetter headwaters, but their volumes are relatively small ({\textless}3 106m3). The annual inflow (∼200 106m3 yr−1) to the Dead Sea from the eastern, semiarid tributaries is divided between base flows (∼65{\%} of annual discharge) and winter floods. In the arid part of the basin, transmission losses and recharge into the shallow alluvial aquifers and probably also to the deeper aquifers during floods are directly related to flow volume. Transmission losses in Nahal Zin decrease with flood magnitude from ∼86{\%} to 100{\%} in small floods of {\textless}10 m3 s−1 to ∼10{\%} for large floods of up to 1500 m3 s−1. During the largest floods, the volume of these losses can exceed 4 106 m3.$\backslash$nRare paleofloods during the past 2000 yr in the Negev were 2–3 times larger than present-day measured floods. The temporal distribution of paleofloods shows that periods with a high frequency of large floods alternate with periods of few large floods. Periods with a high frequency of large floods correlate with high Dead Sea levels, and a low frequency of floods correlates with low lake levels.},

These measures are oversensitive to extreme values (outliers) and are insensitive to additive and proportional differences between model predictions and observations. Because of these limitations, correlation-based measures can indicate that a model is a good predictor, even when it is not. In this paper, useful alternative "Goodness-of-Fit" or relative error measures (including the Coefficient of Efficiency and the Index of Agreement) that overcome many of the limitations of correlation-based measures are discussed. Modifications to these statistics to aid in interpretation are presented. It is concluded that correlation and correlation-based measures should not be used to assess the "Goodness-of-Fit" of a hydrologic or hydroclimatic model and that additional evaluation measures (such as summary statistics and absolute error measures) should supplement model evaluation tools.},

abstract = {In this paper, data from spaceborne radar, lidar and infrared radiometers on the “A-Train” of satellites are combined in a variational algorithm to retrieve ice cloud properties. The method allows a seamless retrieval between regions where both radar and lidar are sensitive to the regions where one detects the cloud. We first implement a cloud phase identification method, including identification of supercooled water layers using the lidar signal and temperature to discriminate ice from liquid. We also include rigorous calculation of errors assigned in the variational scheme. We estimate the impact of the microphysical assumptions on the algorithm when radiances are not assimilated by evaluating the impact of the change in the area-diameter and the density-diameter relationships in the retrieval of cloud properties. We show that changes to these assumptions affect the radar-only and lidar-only retrieval more than the radar-lidar retrieval, although the lidar-only extinction retrieval is only weakly affected. We also show that making use of the molecular lidar signal beyond the cloud as a constraint on optical depth, when ice clouds are sufficiently thin to allow the lidar signal to penetrate them entirely, improves the retrieved extinction. When infrared radiances are available, they provide an extra constraint and allow the extinction-to-backscatter ratio to vary linearly with height instead of being constant, which improves the vertical distribution of retrieved cloud properties.},

abstract = {Climate, lithology, soil and especially, intense land use/cover changes, make SE Spain very vulnerable to runoff generation and water erosion leading to loss of nutrients and organic matter and to infrequent but devastating floods, reservoir siltation and mass failures. This susceptibility has led to heavy economic investment and research efforts since the 1980s, making this region a worldwide reference for understanding the hydrology and geomorphology of semiarid ecosystems. Runoff and soil erosion have been intensively studied throughout the last decades in various natural ecosystems as well as in abandoned farmlands. Research has considered a wide range of methods and spatial and temporal scales. This paper reviews the methods and data describing runoff generation and water erosion, synthesising the key processes involved, rates, thresholds and controlling factors from a scale-dependent perspective. It also identifies the major gaps in current knowledge to provide recommendations for further research towards solutions that reduce the negative impacts of erosion. Research in SE Spain has contributed significantly to a better understanding of the effect of spatial and temporal scale on runoff and sediment yield measurements, and highlighted the important role of distinct erosion and sediment transport processes, hydrologic connectivity, spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall, the occurrence of extreme events and the impacts of land use changes. The most effective ways and challenges to predict runoff, soil erosion and sediment yield at the catchment scale are also discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Between one half and two thirds of the total rainfall in the southernmost, arid part of Israel is of a highly localized type, coming mostly from small convective cells. In a number of storms, the dimensions of such cells could be estimated; the typical diameter was about 5 km. Larger localized systems exist as well. In the instances observed, cells mostly appeared well-separated from each other, both in time and space. Consequently, in a region (or a watershed) of a few hundreds of sq. km., the proportion of the area receiving intensive rainfall on a given day may be as low as 20{\%}. The area covered by individual cells seems to be randomly distributed in space, as long-term average rainfall is uniform throughout the region considered. The number of days on which rain occurs somewhere within that region, is about 50{\%} higher than the number recorded at any single point. Correlation analysis has been used to compare the degree of spottiness in this area and in other climatic regimes. Seasonal differences have also been found. Spottiness is most pronounced in the fall and late spring, whereas spatially uniform rainfall is most likely to occur in mid-winter},

abstract = {Quantitatively estimating rainfall-runoff relations in extremely arid regions is a challenging task, mainly because of lack of in situ data. For the past 40 years, rain and floods have been monitored in the Nahal Yael catchment (0.5 km2) in southern Israel, providing a unique data set of runoff hydrographs and rainfall in a hyper-arid region. Here we present an exploratory study focusing on rainfall-runoff modeling issues for a small (0.05 km2) sub-catchment of Nahal Yael. The event-based model includes the computation of rainfall excess, hillslope and channel routing. Two model parameters of the infiltration process were found by calibration. A resampling methodology of calibration group composition is suggested to derive optimal model parameters and their uncertainty range. Log-based objective functions were found to be more robust and less sensitive than non-log functions to calibration group composition. The fit achieved between observed and computed runoff hydrographs for the calibration and validation events is considered good relative to other modeling studies in arid and semi-arid regions. The study indicates that, under the calibration scheme used, a lumped model performs better than a model representing the catchment division into three sub-catchments. In addition, the use of rain data from several gauges improves runoff prediction as compared to input from a single gauge. It was found that rainfall uncertainty dominates uncertainties in runoff prediction while parameter uncertainties have only a minor effect. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study documents the climatological occurrence of rainfall contributed from different types of rain cloud systems over Israel and the adjacent sea. The rainy cloud types are: a. Cold front. b. Cloud systems that develop in the cold sector of the cyclones. c. Cloudiness of the cyclone center (vortex). The cloud systems within the cold sector include: a. Convection lines. b. Open Benard cells and unorganized cells. c. Coastal front. d. Cloud streets. While the warm front rain yield is negligible, the Red Sea trough adds about 5{\%} to the total precipitation in the Mediterranean climate region of the country. The main rainfall yield contribution in the north of the country comes from cold fronts and vortices while in the southern part is dominated by less dynamically and more air mass convection controlled rain cloud systems, such as Benard cells and coastal front. Analysis of the cloud pattern on a monthly basis reveals that the cold front is more active during November-December and the main vortex activity starts in January, with the climax of the coastal front in December. We checked rainy/dry year variations and found that during rainy years, the vortex rain contribution is larger than that of the cold front. The coastal front also contributes more rain during wet years and tends to follow a more southerly route. In dry years, the proportion of vortex/cold front is reversed, and the coastal front rain yield is meager and has a more northerly route.},

Although there exist some works applying machine learning to air quality prediction, most of the prior studies are restricted to several-year data and simply train standard regression models (linear or nonlinear) to predict the hourly air pollution concentration. In this work, we propose refined models to predict the hourly air pollution concentration on the basis of meteorological data of previous days by formulating the prediction over 24 h as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem. This enables us to select a good model with different regularization techniques. We propose a useful regularization by enforcing the prediction models of consecutive hours to be close to each other and compare it with several typical regularizations for MTL, including standard Frobenius norm regularization, nuclear norm regularization, and

abstract = {Intense rainstorms cause debris flows on escarpments in hyperarid environments. In contrast with more temperate environments, there have been no direct observations on rainfall intensities and durations required for initiating debris flows in hyperarid environments. Here, we report rainfall volume and intensities, acquired by gauge and radar measurements, for two successive storms along the hyperarid ({\textless}50 mm/yr) western escarpment of the Dead Sea basin. These rainfall data were analyzed in conjunction with detailed mapping of debris flows that occurred during these storms to determine values of rainfall intensity and duration required to generate debris flows on the Dead Sea western escarpment. The first of the two analyzed storms occurred on 2 November 1995. During this storm, two convective cells rained sequentially within a 5 It period at the lower reaches of the Nahal David and the Nahal 'Arugot that dissects the western escarpment of the Dead Sea, Israel. This storm triggered debris flows in 38 small ({\textless}3 km(2)) and high-gradient drainage basins along the escarpment. Total rainfall volume and spatial distribution were determined by 10 cumulative rain gauges that were also used to calibrate rainfall-intensity distributions from radar data. For this storm, region, and landscape, rainfall intensities exceeding 30 mm/h for a duration of I h were required to initiate debris flows. A second storm in the same area on 1718 October 1997 allowed the evaluation of the results determined from the 1995 storm. In this second, more regional storm, maximum rainfall intensities were 19-27 mm/h for a duration of 45 min. These values, lower than the 30 mm/h minimal threshold defined in the previous storm, are consistent with the occurrence of only three debris flows. The small number of debris flows resulted from the concentration of the highest intensities of rainfall on the desert plateau and not directly on top of the canyon walls. Most first- to third-order basins draining the Dead Sea escarpment contain evidence of zero to three late Holocene ({\textless}3000 yr) debris flows. From analysis of the two storms, we propose that most of these debris flows were triggered by storms similar to the 2 November 1995 event in which localized convective cells had rainfall intensities of {\textgreater}30 mm/h and durations of at least 1 h. The small number of debris flows that has occurred during the late Holocene indicates that such events are rare at the scale of individual drainage basins.},

abstract = {Summary This study assesses the latest version, Version 7 (V7) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) rainfall estimates by comparison with the previous version, Version 6 (V6), for both near-real-time product (3B42RT) and post-real-time research products (3B42) over the climate-transitional zone in the southern Great Plains, USA. Two basins, the Verdigris River Basin (VRB) in the east and the Upper Washita Basin (UWB) in the west, with distinctive precipitation but similar vegetation and elevation, were selected to evaluate the {\{}TMPA{\}} products using rain gauge-blended products with WSR-88D {\{}NEXRAD{\}} Stage IV. This study sheds important insights into the detailed spatiotemporal precipitation errors, and also reveals algorithm performance during extreme events over the two low-relief basins within a high precipitation gradient zone. Based on nine years of measurements (2002–2010), this study shows that: (1) 3B42V7 corrects the widespread rainfall underestimation from research product 3B42V6, especially for the drier {\{}UWB{\}} with relative bias (RB) improvement from −23.24{\%} to 2.24{\%}. (2) 3B42RTV7 reduces the widespread, notable overestimation from the real-time product 3B42RTV6, with minor overestimation in the wet {\{}VRB{\}} and underestimation in the dry UWB. (3) For both versions of {\{}TMPA{\}} products, larger root mean square error (RMSE) but higher correlation coefficients (CCs) tend to appear for the wet VRB, while lower {\{}RMSE{\}} and {\{}CC{\}} mostly occur in the dry UWB. 3B42RTV7 shows a drawback that the {\{}CC{\}} declines significantly, especially in the dry region where it drops below 0.5. (4) Seasonally, autumn rainfall estimations in both versions and basins have the least bias. The 3B42RTV6 overestimation and 3B42V6 underestimation of spring and summer rainfall, which dominate the annual total bias, are significantly reduced for both basins in the {\{}V7{\}} products. Winter precipitation estimation improvement is also noticeable with significant {\{}RB{\}} and {\{}RMSE{\}} reductions. However, considerable overestimation in summer rainfall still exists for the wet basin. (5) Although {\{}V7{\}} has the overall best performance, it still shows deficiency in detecting extreme rainfall events in low-relief regions, tending to underestimate peak rainfall intensity and to misrepresent timing and locations. Results from this study can be used for reference in the algorithm development of the next generation of Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) scheduled to launch in 2014.},

The abolition of exclusive land use rights in the eastern Sahel in 1971, and the unilateral promotion of land cultivation has triggered off resources mismanagement in the core areas of agro-pastoral activities. In the Butana region (northeast Sudan), site degradation and desertification have already induced a decline in the quality and the quantity of the pastures.

abstract = {While the value of correcting raw radar rainfall estimates using simultaneous ground rainfall observations is well known, approaches that use the complete record of both gauge and radar measurements to provide improved rainfall estimates are much less common. We present here two new approaches for estimating radar rainfall that are designed to address known limitations in radar rainfall products by using a relatively long history of radar reflectivity and ground rainfall observations. The first of these two approaches is a radar rainfall estimation algorithm that is nonparametric by construction. Compared to the traditional gauge adjusted parametric relationship between reflectivity (Z) and ground rainfall (R), the suggested new approach is based on a nonparametric radar rainfall estimation method (NPR) derived using the conditional probability distribution of reflectivity and gauge rainfall. The NPR method is applied to the densely gauged Sydney Terrey Hills radar network, where it reduces the RMSE in rainfall estimates by 10{\%}, with improvements observed at 90{\%} of the gauges. The second of the two approaches is a method to merge radar and spatially interpolated gauge measurements. The two sources of information are combined using a dynamic combinatorial algorithm with weights that vary in both space and time. The weight for any specific period is calculated based on the error covariance matrix that is formulated from the radar and spatially interpolated rainfall errors of similar reflectivity periods in a cross-validation setting. The combination method reduces the RMSE by about 20{\%} compared to the traditional Z-R relationship method, and improves estimates compared to spatially interpolated point measurements in sparsely gauged areas.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method to adjust the mean field bias of radar rainfall estimates in real time. The underlying philosophy for estimation of radar rainfall in real-time used in this study is that the estimated radar rainfall must first be corrected for the reflectivity measurement errors and the Z-R conversion errors based on the physical methods, and thereafter a statistical method is used to remove the average difference (mean field bias) between radar estimates at the rain gauge locations and the corresponding gauge rainfall amounts. Kalman filtering techniques are used as the basis for correcting the mean filed bias in real time. The logarithmic mean field radar rainfall bias is modelled as an Autoregressive order 1 process having a stationary variance. The observation error variance is estimated from a difference between a variance of the observed mean field bias and the stationary variance of the logarithmic bias process. The variance of the observed mean field bias is estimated using a radar rainfall error variance model which depends on (a) the number of rain gauges that measure non-zero rainfall at that hour; (b) the location of these rain gauges; (c) the conditional mean of rain gauge rainfall; and (d) the number of pulses used for reflectivity measurements. A 7-month radar and rain gauge data record from the Kurnell radar in Sydney, Australia are used to test the efficiency of the proposed method. The results shown that the Kalman filtering approach outperforms the use of sample bias correction method when rain gauge density is less than about 1 gauge per 90 km2 for both climatological and stratiform rainfall, and has a higher accuracy compared to the case where no bias correction is performed, irrespective of the number of rain gauges used in the calibration. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The relations between rainfall characteristics and the magnitude of directional bias are shown. The special interest in this study is to locate the combination of factors which maximize the effect of directional bias. Finally, by combination of rainfall movement statistics with modeled runoff, the probability distribution of directional bias for differently oriented catchments in Lund is given.The most important conclusion is that the maximal directional bias observed for real catchments is much smaller than for the conceptual catchment, but still can reach significant values. The maximal bias occurs when the rainfall movement is parallel to direction to conduits and when rain velocity is close to average flow velocity. The highest values of directional bias occur for storms with short durations which give low peak flow discharge without practical importance. Still, the phenomenon of the directional bias can be one of the reasons why frequency of the rainfall does not follow frequency of runoff.},

abstract = {Numerous studies across multiple disciplines search for insights on the effects of climate change at local spatial scales and at fine time resolutions. This study presents an overall methodology of using a weather generator for downscaling an ensemble of climate model outputs. The downscaled predictions can explicitly include climate model uncertainty, which offers valuable information for making probabilistic inferences about climate impacts. The hourly weather generator that serves as the downscaling tool is briefly presented. The generator is designed to reproduce a set of meteorological variables that can serve as input to hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and agricultural models. The generator is capable of reproducing a wide set of climate statistics over a range of temporal scales, from extremes, to low-frequency interannual variability; its performance for many climate variables and their statistics over different aggregation periods is highly satisfactory. The use of the weather generator in simulations of future climate scenarios, as inferred from climate models, is described in detail. Using a previously developed methodology based on a Bayesian approach, the stochastic downscaling procedure derives the frequency distribution functions of factors of change for several climate statistics from a multi-model ensemble of outputs of General Circulation Models. The factors of change are subsequently applied to the statistics derived from observations to re-evaluate the parameters of the weather generator. Using embedded causal and statistical relationships, the generator simulates future realizations of climate for a specific point location at the hourly scale. Uncertainties present in the climate model realizations and the multi-model ensemble predictions are discussed. An application of the weather generator in reproducing present (1961-2000) and forecasting future (2081-2100) climate conditions is illustrated for the location of Tucson (AZ). The stochastic downscaling is carried out using simulations of eight General Circulation Models adopted in the IPCC 4AR, A1B emission scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Yair2004,
abstract = {Many studies have been concerned with the scale issue in geomorphology and hydrology. Most studies focus on the possibility of data transfer from small to large watersheds. Less attention has been given to the scale problem within very small watersheds where differences in slope length may seriously affect the spatial distribution and extent of runoff-contributing areas to the channel. It is usually assumed that runoff and erosion increase as slope length and angle increase. However, field observations in the Negev Highlands show positive relationships between slope length and deposition rates, regardless of slope angles. Short hillslopes are devoid of colluvial mantle, while thick colluvial deposits, with well-developed soil profiles indicative of long-term stability, are found at the base of long hillslopes. The hypothesis advanced is that temporal variations in effective rainfall control the spatial structures of surface properties that further enhance the effects of temporal variations in rainfall. Long-term monitoring of rainfall and runoff (1982-1998), conducted at spatial scales varying from few hundreds of m2 up to 0.3 km2, show a decrease in runoff at the hillslope scale. The low efficiency of runoff and erosion processes on long hillslopes is because the concentration time required for continuous flow along such slopes is longer than the duration of most effective rain showers prevailing in the area. Field data lead to the notion that runoff and erosion models in which a positive relationship between slope length and angle and runoff and erosion rates is assumed should not be applied to arid and semiarid areas. More attention should be given in latter areas to the complex hydrological relationships between rainfall scales and spatial scales. The implications of data obtained regarding the spatial distribution of areas contributing to channel flow, at a geological time scale and under changing climatic conditions, are discussed.

abstract = {A large body of data has been used to study the distribution of instantaneous rainfall intensity in Israel and its variations in space and in time. Time resolution is ±3 minutes. Besides the direct uses that the numerical results may have for practical purposes, the results have been used here to characterize rainfall in a climatologically more meaningful way. This includes reference to the atmospheric processes and surface-conditioned effects that influence rainfall formation, and the identification of regional and seasonal variations in these processes. Thus, it has been shown that contrary to prevalent views, orographic rainfall in Israel is characterized by low intensity, apparently resulting from a continuous advection of moist air through a zone of gradual topographically forced uplifting. In the presentation of results, emphasis has been put also on the significance of results from the point of view of rain-conditioned processes occurring on the earth surface, such as in hydrology, geomorphology, etc. In this context, the water yield from high intensity rainfall has been shown to reflect a high degree of concentration, both areally (through convergence in the atmosphere and run-off processes on the ground surface) and in time (in warm seasons and in certain parts of the day). These features, as well as the relative frequency of high-intensity rains itself, has been shown to be more pronounced in the arid Negev than in the more humid parts of the country. This explains at least in part the increased uncertainty characterizing rainfall in the arid zone.},

abstract = {A stochastic spatial rainfall generator is developed for use at the small spatial scale of urban and small hydrographic catchments. The generator is based on a spatial rainfall model of the conceptual and hierarchical type. It describes the spatial rainfall field in a macroscopic physically-based way by distinguishing rainfall entities with different scales: rain cells, cell clusters, small and large mesoscale areas (or rain storms). For applications at small spatial scales, the individual rain cells need a detailed description. Data of a dense network of rain gauges at Antwerp, enclosing 5940 rain cells in 807 rain storms are used to derive such description. For separation of the rain cells in the rainfall time series, an algorithm is developed based on the identification of increasing and decreasing rain cell flanks. The rain cells observed at different rain gauges are linked together by applying criteria for testing the similarity in rain cell properties. After separating and linking the rain cells and storms, the spatial rainfall model is calibrated to many storms by two methods (e.g. Kalman filter). The derived model structure and model parameter distributions apply to the stochastic generation of long-term time series of spatial rainfall. The model is tested by comparing intensity-duration-frequency relationships and temporal scaling properties of the generated and historical rainfall series. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper aims to clarify the dependence existing between spatial rainfall organisation, basin morphology and runoff response. This is obtained by applying a spatial rainfall metric which describes the spatial rainfall organisation in terms of concentration and dispersion statistics as a function of the flow travel time measured along the river network. The metric is based on the observation that runoff routing through branched channel networks imposes an effective averaging of spatial rainfall excess at equal travel time, in spite of the inherent spatial variability. High resolution radar rainfall fields and a distributed hydrologic model are employed to examine how effective are these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organisation which is important for runoff modelling, and in quantifying the effects of neglecting the spatial rainfall variability on flood modelling. The investigation focuses on three extreme flash flood events occurred on the Carpathian range (Romania) in the period 2005-2007. The size of the study catchments ranges between 36 and 167km2. The analysis reported here shows that neglecting the spatial rainfall variability results in a considerable loss of simulation Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency in almost 30{\%} of the cases (NS less than 0.8), with NS less than 0.6 in one of the cases. This provides a significant documentation of the influence of the spatial rainfall variability on runoff modelling for catchment size less than 160km2. Moreover, it is shown that these rainfall statistics, used in combination, are able to isolate and describe the features of rainfall spatial organisation which have significant impact on runoff simulation. An alternative rainfall spatial variability index, which is computed irrespective of flow travel time structure, provides a comparatively poor description of the influence of neglecting rainfall spatial variability on flood modelling. Overall, this implies that rainfall organisation measured along the river network by using the travel time coordinate may be a significant property of rainfall spatial variability when considering flood response modelling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A generalised framework of space-time variability in flood response is used to characterise five flood events of different type in the Kamp area in Austria: one long-rain event, two short-rain events, one rain-on-snow event and one snowmelt event. Specifically, the framework quantifies the contributions of the space-time variability of rainfall/snowmelt, runoff coefficient, hillslope and channel routing to the flood runoff volume and the delay and spread of the resulting hydrograph. The results indicate that the components obtained by the framework clearly reflect the individual processes which characterise the event types. For the short-rain events, temporal, spatial and movement components can all be important in runoff generation and routing, which would be expected because of their local nature in time and, particularly, in space. For the long-rain event, the temporal components tend to be more important for runoff generation, because of the more uniform spatial coverage of rainfall, while for routing the spatial distribution of the produced runoff, which is not uniform, is also important. For the rain-on-snow and snowmelt events, the spatio-temporal variability terms typically do not play much role in runoff generation and the spread of the hydrograph is mainly due to the duration of the event. As an outcome of the framework, a dimensionless response number is proposed that represents the joint effect of runoff coefficient and hydrograph peakedness and captures the absolute magnitudes of the observed flood peaks. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The safety and security of drinking water distribution systems have recently generated considerable interest because of the credible concern that they could be compromised with chemical, biological, and radiological contaminants. In order to protect public health, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a program to investigate how changes in water quality parameters, which potentially indicate contamination, may be detected by real- or near real- time sensors. The sensors investigated were off-the-shelf commercial products designed to monitor standard drinking water parameters such as pH, free chlorine, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), chloride, ammonia, and nitrate. These sensors were mounted within a recirculating pipe loop and challenged with contaminants including secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, potassium ferricyanide, a malathion insecticidal formulation, a glyphosate herbicidal formulation, nicotine, arsenic trioxide, aldicarb, and E. coli K-12 strain with growth media. Overall, the sensors that responded to most contaminants were those that monitored for free chlorine, TOC, ORP, specific conductance, and chloride. Generally, the technology used in sensor design or the particular manufacturer of the sensor did not affect the response characteristics. These results may help refine the role of water quality sensors in a contamination warning system (CWS) within a water distribution system.},

abstract = {We report a comparative study using three different chemometric techniques to evaluate both spatial and temporal changes in Suquı́a River water quality, with a special emphasis on the improvement obtained using discriminant analysis for such evaluation. We have monitored 22 parameters at different stations from the upper, middle, and beginning of the lower river basin during at least two years including 232 different samples. We obtained a complex data matrix, which was treated using the pattern recognition techniques of cluster analysis (CA), factor analysis/principal components (FA/PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). CA renders good results as a first exploratory method to evaluate both spatial and temporal differences, however it fails to show details of these differences. FA/PCA needs 13 parameters to point out 71{\%} of both temporal and spatial changes; consequently data reduction from FA/PCA in this case is not as considerable as expected. However, FA/PCA allows to group the selected parameters according to common features as well as to evaluate the incidence of each group on the overall change in water quality, specially during the analysis of temporal changes. DA technique shows the best results for data reduction and pattern recognition during both temporal and spatial analysis. DA renders an important data reduction using 6 parameters to afford 87{\%} right assignations during temporal analysis. Besides, it uses only 5 parameters to yield 75{\%} right assignations during the spatial analysis of four different basin areas. DA allowed us to greatly reduce the dimensionality of the starting data matrix, pointing out to a few parameters that indicate the biggest changes in water quality as well as variation patterns associated with seasonal variations, urban run-off, and pollution sources, presenting a novel approach for water quality assessments.},

abstract = {This paper examines the transient development and the steady-state configuration of groundwater within a coastal aquifer adjacent to a stratified saltwater body. Such systems consist of three different water types: the regional fresh groundwater, and low and high salinity brines forming the upper and lower water layers of the stratified water body, respectively. The dynamics, location and the geometry of the interfaces and the density-driven circulation flows that develop in the aquifer are examined using laboratory experiments and numerical modeling at the same scale. The results show that the transient intrusion of the different water bodies into the aquifer takes place at different rates, and that the locations of the interfaces between them change with time, before reaching steady-state. Under steady-state conditions both the model and the experiments show the existence of three interfaces between the three water types. The numerical model, which is calibrated against the salinity distribution and groundwater discharge rate in the laboratory experiments, allows the quantification of the flow rates and flow patterns within the aquifer. These flow patterns, which cannot be derived from laboratory experiments, show the transient development of three circulation cells which are confined between the three interfaces. These results confirm the hypothesis that has been previously suggested based solely on a steady-state numerical modeling defined by a conceptual understanding. Parametric analysis shows that the creation of three circulation cells and three interfaces is limited to certain conditions and defines the ranges for the creation of this unique system. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We propose an extended study of recent flood-triggering storms and resulting hydrological responses for catchments in the Pyrenean foothills up to the Aude region. For hydrometeorological sciences, it appears relevant to characterize flash floods and the storm that triggered them over various temporal and spatial scales. There are very few studies of extreme storm-caused floods in the literature covering the Mediterranean and highlighting, for example, the quickness and seasonality of this natural phenomenon. The present analysis is based on statistics that clarify the dependence between the spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall at catchment scale, catchment morphology and runoff response. Given the specific space and time scales of rainfall cell development, we show that the combined use of radar and a rain gauge network appears pertinent. Rainfall depth and intensity are found to be lower for catchments in the Pyrenean foothills than for the nearby Corbi??res or Montagne Noire regions. We highlight various hydrological behaviours and show that an increase in initial soil saturation tends to foster quicker catchment flood response times, of around 3 to 10. h. The hydrometeorological data set characterized in this paper constitutes a wealth of information to constrain a physics-based distributed model for regionalization purposes in the case of flash floods. Moreover, the use of diagnostic indices for rainfall distribution over catchment drainage networks highlights a unimodal trend in spatial temporal storm distributions for the entire flood dataset. Finally, it appears that floods in mountainous Pyrenean catchments are generally triggered by rainfall near the catchment outlet, where the topography is lower. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Flash-floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems are not able to monitor for rainfall and river discharge.

To this end, the project included actions on the organization of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The final aim of HYDRATE was to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood data and the improved process understanding.

abstract = {Groundwater flow patterns within the freshwater-saltwater interface in coastal aquifers include rotation in the flow direction of saltwater that originates from the sea and circulates in the aquifer. Using two types of tracer experiments we analyze the configuration of the rotating flow-lines. The experimental results are numerically reconstructed and quantitatively compared to the salinity distribution along the interface. The results show that the rotation in the direction of the saltwater flow-lines begins at the lowermost part of the interface (i.e. contour C/Cmax=99{\%}), and completes within its lower tenth (contour C/Cmax=94{\%}). At the upper part of the interface, after the rotation is completed, the flow is dictated by the freshwater flow seaward. Based on these results, the well-known chemical freshwater-saltwater interface is divided into two different parts, defined by their physical properties: (1) the lower part is the "Flow Rotation Region", defined by convective circulating flow-lines; and (2) the upper part is the "Dispersive Region", defined by dispersive dilution. Sensitivity analysis shows that the physical configuration of the interface depends on the transversal dispersivities. At higher dispersivities the rotation width increases, but completes within the lower third of the interface, at most. The sensitivity analysis also shows that the rotation begins at the lowermost part of the interface for dispersivities. Therefore, since no flow occurs below a line of 99{\%}, the saline water that flows seaward is always diluted with respect to its original salinity. These flow patterns might affect coastal processes such as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and chemicals transport through the aquifer.},

abstract = {Gypsum is the source of calcium most commonly used to reclaim sodic soils and to improve soil water infiltration when it has been decreased by low electrolyte concentration. The electrolyte concentration of the soil water and exchangeable sodium fraction, E Na , are the two predominant chemical factors that influence soil hydraulic properties. In sodic soil reclamation with gypsum, the maximum electrolyte concentration increases with increasing E Na : for soil solutions in equilibrium with both gypsum and an E Na of 0 and 0.4, the concentrations are 15 and 133 mol m -3 . These concentrations are generally adequate to maintain the existing hydraulic conductivity. Higher concentrations can increase the soil hydraulic conductivity and the rate of reclamation. Thus, combining calcium chloride or sulphuric acid with gypsum, can reduce both the time and amount of water required to achieve reclamation.},

abstract = {At times, a pronounced trough of low barometric pressure extends from equatorial Africa northward, over the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean countries, i.e., the Red Sea Trough. The associated weather is usually hot and dry, and consequently the atmosphere becomes conditionally unstable. In cases in which additional moisture is supplied and dynamic conditions become supportive, as the case analyzed here, intense thunderstorms occur, with extreme rain rates, hail and floods. The storm herein analyzed caused extensive damage both in casualties and property and evolved in two main consecutive phases: In the first a Mesoscale Convective System that moved from Sinai northward over Israel dominated, and in the second deep convection was organized mainly along a cold front. Data analysis indicates several synoptic-scale factors that had a supportive effect on the storm formation and intensification: Conditional instability established by the Red Sea trough, mid-level moisture transport from Northern Africa, and upper-level divergence imparted by both polar and subtropical jet streams over the Middle-East. Mesoscale features were further investigated by means of a hydro-meteorological observational analysis with high spatio-temporal resolution using raingauge and radar data, and satellite imagery. It is shown that local factors, particularly topographic effects, play a major role in the evolution, intensity and spatial organization of the convective activity. Our findings support results of a numerical study of another autumn rainstorm associated with the Red Sea trough. In the present case we identify an additional contributing factor, i.e., a mid-latitude upper-level trough that further intensified the storm as it was approaching the Middle-East.},

Major floods occurred along 500km of the Paroo River in March 2010 at levels unequaled since 2000. Dual polarization (HH/HV) L-Band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was obtained from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) to evaluate its use for mapping flooding over an area of high conservation value floodplain wetlands. The data were shown to be highly informative for mapping flooded classes and provide an alternative data source to optical imagery in the presence of cloud cover. Due to radar speckle, segmentation was used to partition the scenes within eCognition Developer. Classification was performed on image objects using decision rules based on field verified radar backscatter thresholds of classes and change detection. The methods developed for single and multiple images provide a framework for operational mapping and monitoring water over time, as well as a rapid response strategy for flood emergencies. Future work on image transforms and research on the interoperability of SAR and optical data will aim to improve differentiation of wetland classes. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Air pollution has a proven impact on public health. Currently, pollutant levels are obtained by high-priced, sizeable, stationary Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) stations. Recent developments in sensory and communication technologies have made relatively low-cost, micro-sensing units (MSUs) feasible. Their lower power consumption and small size enable mobile sensing, deploying single or multiple units simultaneously. Recent studies have reported on measurements acquired by mobile MSUs, mounted on cars, bicycles and pedestrians. While these modes of transportation inherently present different velocity and acceleration regimes, the effect of the sensors' varying movement characteristics have not been previously accounted for. This research assesses the impact of sensor's motion on its functionality through laboratory measurements and a field campaign. The laboratory setup consists of a wind tunnel to assess the effect of air flow on the measurements of nitrogen dioxide and ozone at different velocities in a controlled environment, while the field campaign is based on three cars mounted with MSUs, measuring pollutants and environmental variables at different traveling speeds. In both experimental designs we can regard the MSUs as a moving object in the environment, i.e. having a distinct ego-motion. The results show that MSU's behavior is highly affected by variation in speed and sensor placement with respect to direction of movement, mainly due to the physical properties of installed sensors. This strongly suggests that any future design of MSU must account for the speed effect from the design stage all the way through deployment and results analysis. This is the first report examining the influence of airflow variations on MSU's ability to accurately measure pollutant levels.},

abstract = {As a complementary step towards solving the general event detection problem of water distribution systems, injection of the organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos (CP) and parathion (PA), were simulated at various locations within example networks and hydraulic parameters were calculated over 24-h duration. The uniqueness of this study is that the chemical reactions and byproducts of the contaminants' oxidation were also simulated, as well as other indicative water quality parameters such as alkalinity, acidity, pH and the total concentration of free chlorine species. The information on the change in water quality parameters induced by the contaminant injection may facilitate on-line detection of an actual event involving this specific substance and pave the way to development of a generic methodology for detecting events involving introduction of pesticides into water distribution systems. Simulation of the contaminant injection was performed at several nodes within two different networks. For each injection, concentrations of the relevant contaminants' mother and daughter species, free chlorine species and water quality parameters, were simulated at nodes downstream of the injection location. The results indicate that injection of these substances can be detected at certain conditions by a very rapid drop in Cl2, functioning as the indicative parameter, as well as a drop in alkalinity concentration and a small decrease in pH, both functioning as supporting parameters, whose usage may reduce false positive alarms. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Low-cost sensor technology can potentially revolutionise the area of air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor technology. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality are also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end-user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air pollution sensor network.},

Though air pollution imposes significant health costs on the urban community globally, to-day's published data on pollution concentrations is spatially too sparse, and does not allow for sufficiently accurate estimation of exposures for (potentially mobile) individuals in order to make medical inferences. The HazeWatch project described in this paper uses several low-cost mobile sensor units attached to vehicles to measure air pollution concentrations, and users' mobile phones to tag and upload the data in real time. The greater spatial granularity of data thus collected enables creation of pollution maps of metropolitan Sydney viewable in real-time over the web, as well as personalized apps that show the individual's exposure history and allow for route planning to reduce future exposure. We share the insights we obtained from building and trialling such a system in Sydney, and highlight challenges that can be addressed collaboratively by groups developing similar systems world-wide.},

abstract = {A 10-yr climatological study of Tropical Plumes (TPs) observed over the Middle East was undertaken. Several tools were used to identify and analyze these mid-tropospheric elongated cloudbands: satellite images, reanalysis and radiosonde data, backward trajectories, and cluster analysis. In order to conduct an in-depth examination of the synoptic conditions controlling this tropical–extratropical phenomenon, a dual methodology was adopted. In the first analysis, the identified 45 plumes were classified to precipitative and non-precipitative. In the second analysis, backward trajectories of the plumes were clustered in order to detect their moisture origins and pathways. In addition to the well documented south-western plumes originating in West Africa, a more southern pathway was identified, in which moisture was transported from Central to East African sources. The ‘south-western' plumes are associated with a southwards penetration of mid-latitude troughs, associated with an intensified thermal wind and a longer jet streak, extending as far as Northwestern Africa. In the ‘southern' category the Sub-Tropical Jet is associated with an anticyclonic flow over the south of the Arabian Peninsula, serving as an essential vehicle advecting moisture from tropical origins. This moisture pathway is considerably shorter than the south-western one. Several conditions favor precipitation induced by TPs over the domain: a northward migration of the jet streak resulting in a weakening of the wind speed over the target area, a deeper trough at the 500hPa level and a shorter moisture corridor.},

abstract = {In this study, a dynamic thresholds scheme is developed and demonstrated for contamination event detection in water distribution systems. The developed methodology is based on a recently published article of the authors (Perelman et al., 2012). Event detection in water supply systems is aimed at disclosing abnormal hydraulic or water quality events by exploring the time series behavior of routine hydraulic (e.g., flow, pressure) and water quality measurements (e.g., residual chlorine, pH, turbidity). While event detection raises alerts to the possibility of an event occurrence, it does not relate to origins, thus an event may be hydraulically-driven, as a consequence of problems like sudden leakages or pump/pipe malfunctions. Most events, however, are related to deliberate, accidental, or natural contamination intrusions. The developed methodology herein is based on off-line and on-line stages. During the off-line stage, a genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized for tuning five decision variables: positive and negative filters, positive and negative dynamic thresholds, and window size. During the on-line stage, a recursively Bayes' rule is invoked, employing the five decision variables, for real time on-line event detection. Using the same database, the proposed methodology is compared to Perelman et al. (2012), showing considerably improved detection ability. Metadata and the computer code are provided as Supplementary material. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Numerous sources of these errors are due to parameter estimation, the observational system and measurement principles, and not fully understood physical processes. Propagation of these uncertainties through all models for which radarrainfall are used as input (e.g., hydrologic models) or as initial conditions (e.g., weather forecasting models) is necessary to enhance the understanding and interpretation of the obtained results. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive literature review of the principal sources of error affecting single polarization radar-based rainfall estimates. These include radar miscalibration, attenuation, ground clutter and anomalous propagation, beam blockage, variability of the Z–R relation, range degradation, vertical variability of the precipitation system, vertical air motion and precipitation drift, and temporal sampling errors.

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {Radar rainfall estimation for flash flood forecasting in small, urban catchments is examined through analyses of radar, rain gage and discharge observations from the 14.3 km2 Dead Run drainage basin in Baltimore County, Maryland. The flash flood forecasting problem pushes the envelope of rainfall estimation to time and space scales that are commensurate with the scales at which the fundamental governing laws of land surface processes are derived. Analyses of radar rainfall estimates are based on volume scan WSR-88D reflectivity observations for 36 storms during the period 2003-2005. Gage-radar analyses show large spatial variability of storm total rainfall over the 14.3 km2 basin for flash flood producing storms. The ability to capture the detailed spatial variation of rainfall for flash flood producing storms by WSR-88D rainfall estimates varies markedly from event to event. As spatial scale decreases from the 14.3 km2 scale of the Dead Run watershed to 1 km2 (and the characteristic time scale of flash flood producing rainfall decreases from 1 h to 15 min) the predictability of flash flood response from WSR-88D rainfall estimates decreases sharply. Storm to storm variability of multiplicative bias in storm total rainfall estimates is a dominant element of the error structure of radar rainfall estimates, and it varies systematically over the warm season and with flood magnitude. Analyses of the 7 July 2004 and 28 June 2005 storms illustrate microphysical and dynamical controls on radar estimation error for extreme flash flood producing storms. ?? 2007.},

Despite benefits ranging from detecting malfunctioning sensors to adaptive sampling, the limited number and complexity of existing real-time platforms across environmental domains pose a barrier to the adoption of real-time data. We present an architecture built upon 1) the increasing availability of new technologies to expose environmental sensors as web services, and 2) the merging of these services under recent innovations on the Internet of Things (IoT). By leveraging recent developments in the IoT arena, the environmental sciences stand to make significant gains in the use of real-time data. We describe a use case in the hydrologic sciences, where an adaptive sampling algorithm is successfully deployed to optimize the use of a constrained sensor network resource.},

abstract = {A method for classifying synoptic-scale maps into discrete groups is introduced. Tree-based recursive partitioning models are used to develop mappings between synoptic-scale circulation fields and the leading linear and nonlinear principal components (PCs) of weather elements observed at a surface station. Statistically unique but climatically insignificant patterns are avoided by identifying map patterns based on their association with indices related to local weather conditions. The method requires few user-adjustable parameters and includes an algorithm that provides objective guidance for determining the appropriate number of map patterns to retain. The classification method is demonstrated using daily sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height maps from a domain covering British Columbia and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The linear and nonlinear weather element PCs are derived from daily measurements of surface temperature, dewpoint temperature, cloud opacity, and u and $\upsilon$ wind components taken at Vancouver, British Columbia. Classification performance is tested by applying the method to precipitation and air quality scenarios. Results are compared with those from unsupervised map-pattern classifications based on the k-means clustering algorithm. Results from recursive partitioning models using linear weather element PCs as targets were better than those from the k-means algorithm. Recursive partitioning trees using nonlinear PCs as targets performed slightly worse than those using linear PCs as targets. Interestingly, trees using gridpoint circulation data as inputs outperformed models that used truncated PCs of the circulation data as inputs. Poorer results were found not to result from loss of information due to truncation of the PCs. Instead, the way information is encoded in principal component analysis (PCA) may be responsible for the poor classification performance in the recursive partitioning models using circulation PCs as inputs.},

abstract = {The maximum historic rainfall-runoff floods measured in the United States, the People's Republic of China and the world all plot close to a smooth curve of drainage area versus discharge. In the United States, the possibility that flood peaks were overestimated and the closeness of these peaks to the probable maximum floods suggest that this limiting curve of maximum floods will not significantly change position with more data. Data for future floods that plot above this curve need to be examined carefully. The most likely interpretations for new data points above the curve would be the confusion of a mud or debris flow with a water-dominated flood, or the damming of channels by debris or a landslide and subsequent bursting. In the United States, excluding Hawaii, the largest measured historic floods in basins less than about 1000 km2, all occurred in arid and semi-arid areas. In China, the majority of the largest measured historic floods occurred in the east and southeast in basins on the windward side of mountainous areas, and in locations affected by typhoons. One extraordinary flood that exceeds any other recorded flood in the world for the size of the drainage basin in which it occurred is the New Caledonia flood of December 24, 1981 on the Ouaieme River. Worldwide, the largest measured historic floods occurred primarily between 40??N and 40??S latitude on streams and rivers near coastal areas. ?? 1987.},

Algorithm inputs include the satellite-derived cloud-top temperature, thermodynamic phase, water path, and effective droplet size. The icing-top and -base altitude boundaries are estimated from the satellite-derived cloud-top and -base altitudes using the freezing level obtained from numerical weather analyses or a lapse-rate approach. The product is available at the nominal resolution of the satellite pixel. Aircraft pilot reports (PIREPs) over the United States and southern Canada provide direct observations of icing and are used extensively in the algorithm development and validation on the basis of correlations with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite imager data. Verification studies using PIREPs, Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting, and NASA Icing Remote Sensing System data indicate that the satellite algorithm performs reasonably well, particularly during the daytime. The algorithm is currently being run routinely using data taken from a variety of satellites across the globe and is providing useful information on icing conditions at high spatial and temporal resolutions that are unavailable from any other source.},

abstract = {The estimation of precipitation rates and accumulations constitutes an essential input data for distributed hydrological models and for many hydrometeorological applications, such as short term hydro-scheduling, forecasting and monitoring of river floods and inflow forecasting into a catchment, its peak flow and response time. In order to improve quantitative precipitation estimates from C-band weather radar, variable Z-R relationships that represent the local precipitation characteristics and conditions are derived from measured precipitation drop size distribution (DSD) by two ground-based instruments: vertical pointing Doppler radar MRR and the optical disdrometer OTT Parsivel. The variability and robustness of those local Z-R relationships are analyzed, as well as their level of dependency to the storm type (stratiform, convective, air mass convection), to the precipitation phase (rain, snow, mixed precipitation), to each event and to each month. Comparative analysis of the precipitation accumulations measured or estimated by three different local instruments (tipping bucket rain gauge, disdrometer OTT Parsivel, vertical pointing radar MRR) is also performed in order to assess under which conditions those instruments are able to provide reliable precipitation rates and robust local Z-R relationships. MRR provides the most variable and uncertain local Z-R parameters that are highly dependent on the precipitation phase. This dependency leads to high event-to-event variability of DSDmeasured Z-R relations and large differences in estimated precipitation rates and accumulations (especially for snow) between the local instruments and compared to precipitation values estimated from the weather radar, using the standard Z-R relationship. The optical disdrometer OTT Parsivel provides the most stable and robust Z-R parameters that are independent of the precipitation phase and the season. In the only case of rain events, both instruments derive similar local Z-R parameters that are comparable to the standard Z-R relationship. The high variability and uncertainty related to Z-R parameters concern mainly mixed precipitations. There is no evident dependency of Z-R parameters on storm type. When comparing the three local precipitation instruments, they all provide similar rain accumulations. In cases of snow and mixed precipitation, accumulations derived from those viii instruments are quite different. However, the disdrometer OTT Parsivel and the tipping bucket rain gauge agree relatively well in terms of accumulations. In addition that OTT Parsivel may provide robust local Z-R relationships for any kind of precipitation that correspond well to standard Z-R relationship, it may compensate for precipitation losses, catch deficit and low temporal resolution of the conventional rain gauge. However, long periods of instrument instability and breakdowns for the disdrometer reduce significantly the number of valid precipitation data available at any time of the year and any precipitation conditions, hence the data representativity of this instrument. In case of MRR, more investigations and possibly better measurement filtering and correction prior to the precipitation estimation may reduce the uncertainties around the MRR-derived Z-R parameters and precipitation estimates.},

abstract = {An experimental study of water fluxes from roofs in a residential area has quantified water fluxes from different types of roof and identified the major controls on the process. Roofs with pitches of 0°, 22° and 50° and orientations of 15° (from true north) (NNE) and 103° (ESE) were selected. A novel automatic system for monitoring has been developed. Noticeable differences in rainfall, runoff and evaporation were found for different roof slopes, aspects and heights. Depending on height, flat roofs collected 90 to 99{\%} of rainfall recorded at ground level. Roofs with a 22° slope; facing south-south-west (i.e. facing the prevailing wind) captured most rain, whereas east-south-east facing roofs with slopes of 50° received the least. Depending on the roof slope, the average rainfall captured ranged from 62 to 93{\%} of that at ground level. For the same slope, the results indicated that from roofs orientated normal to the prevailing wind; (i) captured rainfall was higher, (ii) evaporation was higher and (iii) runoff was less than that from roofs having other aspects. Monthly variations in the runoff–rainfall ratio followed the rainfall distribution, being lowest in summer and highest in winter. The highest mean ratio (0{\textperiodcentered}91) was associated with the steeper roof slope; the lowest ratio (0{\textperiodcentered}61) was for roofs facing the prevailing wind direction. For the same amount of rainfall, the runoff generated from a steeper roof was significantly higher than that generated by a moderate roof slope, but the lowest runoff was from roofs facing the prevailing wind. The results have also shown that the amount of runoff collected (under UK climatic condition) was sufficient to supply an average household in the studied area with the major part of its annual water requirements. The use of this water not only represents a financial gain for house owners but also will help protect the environment by reducing demand on water resources through the reduction of groundwater abstraction, construction of new reservoirs, and a reduction of the flood risk as its in situ use is considered a preventive measure known as a source control.

abstract = {Instead of vision, many nocturnal animals use alternative senses for navigation and object detection in their dark environment. For this purpose, weakly electric mormyrid fish employ active electrolocation, during which they discharge a specialized electric organ in their tail which discharges electrical pulses. Each discharge builds up an electrical field around the fish, which is sensed by cutaneous electroreceptor organs that are distributed over most of the body surface of the fish. Nearby objects distort this electrical field and cause a local alteration in current flow in those electroreceptors that are closest to the object. By constantly monitoring responses of its electroreceptor organs, a fish can detect, localize, and identify environmental objects. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of weakly electric fish in detecting and recognizing objects, we designed technical sensor systems that can solve similar problems of remote object sensing. We applied the principles of active electrolocation to technical systems by building devices that produce electrical current pulses in a conducting medium (water or ionized gases) and simultaneously sense local current density. Depending on the specific task a sensor was designed for devices could (i) detect an object, (ii) localize it in space, (iii) determine its distance, and (iv) measure properties such as material properties, thickness, or material faults. Our systems proved to be relatively insensitive to environmental disturbances such as heat, pressure, or turbidity. They have a wide range of applications including material identification, quality control, non-contact distance measurements, medical applications and many more. Despite their astonishing capacities, our sensors still lag far behind what electric fish are able to achieve during active electrolocation. The understanding of the neural principles governing electric fish sensory physiology and the corresponding optimization of our sensors to solve certain technical tasks therefore remain ongoing goals of our research. ?? 2007 Jilin University.},

abstract = {The use of data collected from near-miss reports has added value to safety in high-hazard industries such as aviation and the process industry, but this procedure has not yet taken root in construction management practice. Although the management of near-miss reporting systems and the collection of near-miss event reports have been the focus of recent research efforts, the structural analyses of reports have not yet been investigated. This paper reports on a multi-phase research that studied near misses related to crane work and their safety risk potential. Former research stages concentrated on collecting near-miss as well as accident stories and established a structured database of tower-crane related events. The reported events were further classified into five homogeneous clusters and their potential for escalating into accidents at a given outcome severity level was assessed. The research stage reported in this paper builds on the results of the previous stage results, and implements the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the quantitative outcome severity level values, thus computing each event's total risk potential. The research outcomes reveal inter-relations between technical factors and human factors in the tower-crane domain. Further application is demonstrated, using the risk potential values for construction company safety assessments.},

abstract = {The typical short generation length of insects makes their population dynamics highly sensitive not only to mean annual temperatures but also to their intra-annual variations. To consider the combined effect of both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species population responses to inter- and intra-annual temperature changes. This framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions: Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain), and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing current and future (mid-21st century) climatic conditions under two emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in population size. High variability in population size was observed between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40° during the next 50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose a modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and agricultural ecosystems.},

abstract = {AbstractThe realistic representation of rainfall on the local scale in climate models remains a key challenge. Realism encompasses the full spatial and temporal structure of rainfall, and is a key indicator of model skill in representing the underlying processes. In particular, if rainfall is more realistic in a climate model, there is greater confidence in its projections of future change.In this study, the realism of rainfall in a very high-resolution (1.5 km) regional climate model (RCM) is compared to a coarser-resolution 12-km RCM. This is the first time a convection-permitting model has been run for an extended period (1989–2008) over a region of the United Kingdom, allowing the characteristics of rainfall to be evaluated in a climatological sense. In particular, the duration and spatial extent of hourly rainfall across the southern United Kingdom is examined, with a key focus on heavy rainfall.Rainfall in the 1.5-km RCM is found to be much more realistic than in the 12-km RCM.

abstract = {Climate change scenarios with a high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural potential and agricultural risk. Such scenarios should reproduce changes in mean weather characteristics as well as incorporate the changes in climate variability indicated by the global climate model (GCM) used. Recent work on the sensitivity of crop models and climatic extremes has clearly demonstrated that changes in variability can have more profound effects on crop yield and on the probability of extreme weather events than simple changes in the mean values. The construction of climate change scenarios based on spatial regression downscaling and on the use of a local stochastic weather generator is described. Regression downscaling translated the coarse resolution GCM grid-box predictions of climate change to site-specific values. These values were then used to perturb the parameters of the stochastic weather generator in order to simulate site-specific daily weather data. This approach permits the incorporation of changes in the mean and variability of climate in a consistent and computationally inexpensive way. The stochastic weather generator used in this study, LARS-WG, has been validated across Europe and has been shown to perform well in the simulation of different weather statistics, including those climatic extremes relevant to agriculture. The importance of downscaling and the incorporation of climate variability are demonstrated at two European sites where climate change scenarios were constructed using the UK Met.

abstract = {The Israel National Cancer Registry reported in 2001 that cancer incidence rates in the Haifa area are roughly 20{\%} above the national average. Since Haifa has been the major industrial center in Israel since 1930, concern has been raised that the elevated cancer rates may be associated with historically high air pollution levels. This work tests whether persistent spatial patterns of metrics of chronic exposure to air pollutants are associated with the observed patterns of cancer incidence rates. Risk metrics of chronic exposure to PM10, emitted both by industry and traffic, and to SO2, a marker of industrial emissions, was developed. Ward-based maps of standardized incidence rates of three prevalent cancers: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung cancer and bladder cancer were also produced. Global clustering tests were employed to filter out those cancers that show sufficiently random spatial distribution to have a nil probability of being related to the spatial non-random risk maps. A Bayesian method was employed to assess possible associations between the morbidity and risk patterns, accounting for the ward-based socioeconomic status ranking. Lung cancer in males and bladder cancer in both genders showed non-random spatial patterns. No significant associations between the SO2-based risk maps and any of the cancers were found. Lung cancer in males was found to be associated with PM10, with the relative risk associated with an increase of 1$\mu$g/m3of PM10being 12{\%}. Special consideration of wards with expected rates {\textless}1 improved the results by decreasing the variance of the spatially correlated residual log-relative risk. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Regional-scale applications of the model in seasonal catchments in Tunisia and Senegal characterize runoff and soil moisture distribution and dynamics in response to varying rainfall data inputs and soil properties. The results highlight the need for hourly-based rainfall simulation and for correcting TRMM 3B42 rainfall intensities for the fractional cover of rainfall (FCR). Without FCR correction and disaggregation to 1 km, TRMM 3B42 based rainfall intensities are too low to generate surface runoff and to induce substantial changes to soil moisture storage. The outcomes from the sensitivity analysis show that topsoil porosity is the most important soil property for simulation of runoff and soil moisture. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of hydrological investigations at a scale, for which reliable information on soil profile characteristics exists and which is sufficiently fine to account for the heterogeneities of these. Where such information is available, application of DryMOD can assist in the spatial and temporal planning of water harvesting according to runoff-generating areas and the runoff ratio, as well as in the optimization of agricultural activities based on realistic representation of soil moisture conditions.},

abstract = {Deep convective storms in subtropical South America are some of the most intense in the world, and the hydrological cycle plays an important role in both tropical and subtropical South America. Recent studies have suggested that the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar algorithm significantly underestimates surface rainfall in deep convection over land. This study investigates the range of the rain bias in storms containing four different types of extreme radar echoes: deep convective cores, deep and wide convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions over South America. Storms with deep convective cores show the greatest underestimation, and the bias is unrelated to their echo top height. The bias in wide convective cores relates to the echo top, indicating that storms with significant mixed phase and ice hydrometeors are similarly affected by assumptions in the TRMM algorithm. The relationship between storm type and rain bias remains similar in both subtropical and tropical regions.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods have been employed with regard to 26 sets of physical and chemical pollution data obtained from the Melen River by the Turkish State Hydraulic Works during the period of 1995–2006. Water-quality data are divided into two parts relating to the high- and low-flow periods for the 1 KMP, 2 BMP, and 3 BMA stations. The self organizing map–artificial neural networks (SOM–ANNs) is employed to evaluate the high–low flow period correlations in terms of water-quality parameters. This is done in order to extract the most important parameters in assessing high–low flow period variations in terms of river water quality. The map size chosen is 9 × 9 in order to ensure that the maximum number of groups would be obtained from the training data. The groups explaining the pollution sources are identified as being responsible for the data structure at each dataset. The SOM, supported by ANN, is applied to provide a nonlinear relationship between input variables and output variables in order to determine the most significant parameters in each group. The multilayer feed-forward NN is chosen for this study. The most crucial parameters are determined, and the groups are conditionally named as mineral structure; soil structure and erosion; domestic, municipal, and industrial effluents; agricultural activity waste-disposal sites; and seasonal effects factors. Based on the explanation of the parameters, we can have an opinion about other parameters which can lead to cost and time savings. The aim of this study is to illustrate the usefulness of artificial intelligence for the evaluation of complex data in river- and water-quality assessment identification, and pollution sources, for effective water-quality management.},

The climatology created using precipitation features defined from the TRMM precipitation radar (PR) shows that the population of features includes a large number of small, weak features that do not produce much rain and are very shallow. A lesser percentage of large, stronger features contributes most of the region's rainfall. Dividing the features into categories based on the median values of volumetric rainfall and maximum height of the 30-dBZ echo is a useful way to visualize the population of features, and the categories selected reflect the life cycle of monsoonal convection. An examination of the top rain-producing features at different elevations reveals that extreme features tend to occur at lower elevations later in the day.

abstract = {A conceptual lumped rainfall-runoff flood event model was developed and applied on the Gardon catchment located in Southern France and various single-objective and multi-objective functions were used for its calibration. The model was calibrated on 15 events and validated on 14 others. The results of both the calibration and validation phases are compared on the basis of their performance with regards to six criteria, three global criteria and three relative criteria representing volume, peakflow, and the root mean square error. The first type of criteria gives more weight to large events whereas the second considers all events to be of equal weight. The results show that the calibrated parameter values are dependent on the type of criteria used. Significant trade-offs are observed between the different objectives: no unique set of parameters is able to satisfy all objectives simultaneously. Instead, the solution to the calibration problem is given by a set of Pareto optimal solutions. From this set of optimal solutions, a balanced aggregated objective function is proposed, as a compromise between up to three objective functions. The single-objective and multi-objective calibration strategies are compared both in terms of parameter variation bounds and simulation quality. The results of this study indicate that two well chosen and non-redundant objective functions are sufficient to calibrate the model and that the use of three objective functions does not necessarily yield different results. The problems of non-uniqueness in model calibration, and the choice of the adequate objective functions for flood event models, emphasise the importance of the modeller's intervention. The recent advances in automatic optimisation techniques do not minimise the user's responsibility, who has to choose multiple criteria based on the aims of the study, his appreciation on the errors induced by data and model structure and his knowledge of the catchment's hydrology.},

abstract = {Highly supercooled rain and drizzle from cloud tops at -12 to -21 degrees C down to the 0 degrees isotherm was documented by aircraft observations in clouds over a wide range of meteorological situations under relatively pristine marine aerosol conditions. The Gulfstream-1 aircraft during the CalWater campaign in February and early March 2011 measured clouds over the coastal waters of northern California, orographically triggered convective clouds over the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, and orographic layer clouds over Yosemite National Park. Supercooled drizzle in layer clouds near Juneau, Alaska, was measured by the Wyoming King Air as part of a FAA project to study aircraft icing in this region. Low concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were commonly observed in all of these clouds, allowing for the formation of clouds with small concentrations of mostly large drops that coalesced into supercooled drizzle and raindrops. Another common observation was the absence of ice nuclei (IN) and/or ice crystals in measurable concentrations, associated with persistent supercooled drizzle and rain. Average ice crystal concentrations were 0.007l(-1) at the top of convective clouds at -12 degrees C and 0.03l(-1) in the case of layer clouds at -21 degrees C. In combination, these two conditions of low concentrations of CCN and very few IN provide ideal conditions for the formation of highly supercooled drizzle and rain. These results help explain the anomalously high incidences of aircraft icing at cold temperatures in U.S. west coast clouds and highlight the need to include aerosol effects when simulating aircraft icing with cloud models.},

The results regarding the WTPs were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) with 75{\%} of the total variance being explained. A stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model constructed from the 89 treated water samples was used to predict class membership of the samples from the NWTs with a view to estimating the propagation of a possible water quality deterioration originating from the WTPs. The model utilized Cl-, Al and EC and yielded a 96{\%} correct classification of the training dataset, whereas the cross-validation yielded a 94{\%} correct classification. Network tank samples were 95{\%} correctly classified with regard to their theoretically expected origin. The stepwise discriminant analysis based on separate covariance matrices of the canonical discriminant functions yielded a 98{\%} correct classification of both the training dataset and the network tank samples. The classification and regression tree (C{\&}RT) algorithm showed that the main parameters used in the discrimination of the WTP samples were EC and Al. The post-hoc classification of the training dataset was 99{\%}, whereas 88{\%} of NWT samples were correctly classified. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Data measuring airborne pollutants, public health and environmental factors are increasingly being stored and merged. These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. RESULTS Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.},

This paper reviews models for assessing intraurban exposure under six classes, including: (i) proximity-based assessments, (ii) statistical interpolation, (iii) land use regression models, (iv) line dispersion models, (v) integrated emission-meteorological models, and (vi) hybrid models combining personal or household exposure monitoring with one of the preceding methods. We enrich this review of the modelling procedures and results with applied examples from Hamilton, Canada. In addition, we qualitatively evaluate the models based on key criteria important to health effects assessment research. Hybrid models appear well suited to overcoming the problem of achieving population representative samples while understanding the role of exposure variation at the individual level. Remote sensing and activity-space analysis will complement refinements in pre-existing methods, and with expected advances, the field of exposure assessment may help to reduce scientific uncertainties that now impede policy intervention aimed at protecting public health.},

abstract = {Rainfall and flood data are relatively sparse in semi-arid areas; hence there have been relatively few investigations into the relationships between rainfall inputs and flood generation in these environments. Previous work has shown that flood properties are influenced by a combination of precipitation characteristics including amount, intensity, duration and spatial distribution. Therefore floods may be produced by high intensity, short duration storms, or longer duration, low intensity rainfall. Most of this research has been undertaken in small catchments in either hyper-arid or relatively high rainfall Mediterranean climates. This paper presents results from a 6 year data record in south-east Spain from research conducted in two basins, the Rambla Nogalte (171 km2) and the Rambla de Torrealvilla (200 km2). Data cover an area of approximately 500 km2 and an annual average rainfall of 300 mm. At coarse temporal resolutions gauges spread over large areas record similar patterns of rainfall, although spells of rain show much more complexity; pulses of rain within storms can vary considerably in total rainfall, intensity and duration over the same area. The analysis for south-east Spain shows that most storms occur over a period of less than 24 h, but that the number of rainfall events declines as the duration exceeds 8 h. This is at odds with data on floods for the study area suggesting that they are produced by storms lasting longer than 18 h. However, one flood event was produced by a very short (15 min) storm with high intensity rainfall. Most floods tended to occur in May/June or September, which coincides with wetter months of the year (September, October, December and May). Floods are also more highly related to the total rainfall occurring in a spell of rain, than to intensity. The complexity of storm rainfall increases with the storm total, which makes it difficult to generalize on the importance of rainfall intensity for flood generation.

abstract = {This study examines effects of tides on fluctuations of the fresh-saline water interface and the groundwater level in unconfined coastal aquifers using a two-dimensional numerical model. The time-lags of the simulated hydraulic heads and salinities fluctuations compared to sea level fluctuations are analyzed using cross-correlation analysis. The results show that both the fresh-saline water interface and the groundwater level are affected harmonically by sea tide fluctuations. However, significantly different time-lags are obtained between the hydraulic head in the deeper and upper parts of the aquifer, and between head and salinity in the fresh-saline water interface. The hydraulic head in the deeper part of the aquifer responses much faster to sea level fluctuations than in the upper part. Surprisingly, a similar difference is detected between the time-lag of the hydraulic head in the fresh-saline water interface and the time-lag of the salinity at the same location. Furthermore, the time-lag of the salinity in the fresh-saline water interface is similar to the time-lag of the water table. We suggest a comprehensive mechanism for tidal influence on the coastal groundwater system, in which two main processes act simultaneously. First, sea tide causes a pressure head wave which propagates into the saturated zone of the aquifer, governed by the diffusivity of the aquifer (Ks/Ss). Second, this pressure head wave is attenuated at the water table due to the unsaturated flow within the capillary fringe which occurs during groundwater level oscillations. Because the tidal forcing acts on the sea-floor boundary and the attenuation of the groundwater level due to capillary effect acts on the groundwater table, two dimensional distributions of time-lag and hydraulic head amplitude are created. The capillary effect in the unsaturated zone plays a key role not only in the water table fluctuations as shown previously, but also on the salinity fluctuations in the fresh-saline water interface. Unsaturated flow dynamics controls the actual movement of the entire fresh water body, which results in simultaneous fluctuations of the groundwater level and the fresh-saline water interface.},

For select sensors that had moderate to strong correlation with reference monitors (r{\&}thinsp;{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;0.5), step-wise multiple linear regression was performed to determine if ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH), or age of the sensor in sampling days could be used in a correction algorithm to improve the agreement.

A four-node sensor network was successfully able to capture ozone (2 nodes) and PM (4 nodes) data for an 8 month period of time and show expected diurnal concentration patterns, as well as potential ozone titration due to near-by traffic emissions. Overall, this study demonstrates a straightforward methodology for establishing low-cost air quality sensor performance in a real-world setting and demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a local sensor network to measure ambient air quality trends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The weathering of carbonate rocks plays a critical role in the evolution of landscapes, the erosion of buildings and monuments, and the global-scale shifting of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean. Chemical dissolution is often assumed to govern the rates of weathering of carbonate rocks, although some studies have suggested that mechanical erosion could also play an important role. Quantifying the rates of the different processes has proved challenging, in part due to the high degree of variability encountered across different scales in both field and laboratory conditions. To constrain the rates and mechanisms controlling long-term limestone weathering, we analyze a lidar scan of the Western Wall, a Roman-period edifice located in Jerusalem. We find that extreme erosion rates in fine-grained micritic limestone blocks are as much as two orders of magnitude higher than the average rates estimated for coarse-grained limestone blocks at the same site. Atomic force microscope imaging of dissolving micritic limestone suggests that these elevated reaction rates are likely to be the result of rapid dissolution along micron-scale grain boundaries, followed by mechanical detachment of tiny particles from the surface. Our analysis indicates that such grain detachment could be the dominant erosional mode for fine-grained carbonate rocks in many regions on Earth.},

abstract = {Orographic effects on tornadic supercell development, propagation, and structure are investigated using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) with idealized bell-shaped mountains of various heights and a homogeneous fluid flow with a single sounding. It is found that blocking effects are dominative compared to the terrain-induced environmental heterogeneity downwind of the mountain. The orographic effect shifted the track of the storm towards the the left of storm motion, particularly on the lee side of the mountain, when compared to the track in the case with no mountain. The terrain blocking effect also enhanced the supercells inflow, which was increased more than one hour before the storm approached the terrain peak. This allowed the central region of the storm to exhibit clouds with a greater density of hydrometeors than the control. Moreover, the enhanced inflow increased the areal extent of the supercells precipitation, which, in turn enhanced the cold pool outflow serving to enhance the storm's updraft until becoming strong enough to undercut and weaken the storm considerably. Another aspect of the orographic effects is that down slope winds produced or enhanced low-level vertical vorticity directly under the updraft when the storm approached the mountain peak.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A stochastic weather generator is a model capable of generating daily weather patterns that are statistically similar to the observed patterns. Weather generators are commonly used in climate change studies as a computationally inexpensive tool to generate high resolution climate change scenarios based on the output from global climate models. Considering that the frequency and the magnitude of extreme weather events are likely to increase under climate change, there is a growing need to investigate how well weather extremes are simulated by weather generators. The aim of this study was to test the skill of the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator to simulate extreme weather events at 20 locations with diverse climates. Yearly maxima of daily precipitation, maximum temperature and length of heat waves, and their 10 and 20 yr return values were compared for observed and synthetic data by fitting the generalized extreme value distribution and computing confidence intervals. Means of yearly maxima and return values of daily synthetic precipitation were within the 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI95) of observed data for all sites. Daily maximum temperature extremes were reproduced less accurately. Although the root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated for the means of maxima of maximum temperature was {\textless}1°C, synthetic means for approximately half of the sites were outside the CI95 for observed values. This indicates that the assumption used in LARS-WG, that daily temperature could be approximated by the normal distribution, is inadequate. Means of yearly maxima for length of heat waves and 10 and 20 yr return values were within the CI95 for all sites except 3. For those sites where LARS-WG performance was inadequate, daily maximum temperature was not normally distributed but was skewed.},

abstract = {Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models. We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20-100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS). Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate. Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of NO2, NOx, PM2.5, the soot content of PM2.5and VOCs in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models. Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale. There is a strong need for validation of LUR models with personal exposure monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Lake Eyre is the terminal playa in a large closed basin which receives the majority of its moisture from the summer monsoon. Modern Lake Eyre receives intermittent floodings at times of increased monsoon intensity, generally associated with the La Ni{\~{n}}a phase of the ENSO cycle. Lake Eyre was a perennial lake during several phases of increased monsoon activity during the late Quaternary, specifically about 125 ka, 80 ka, 65 ka, and 40 ka [Magee (1997) Late Quaternary Environments and Palaeohydrology of Lake Eyre, Arid Central Australia. Unpubl. Ph.D. Thesis, Australian National University, Canberra]. These lake highstands are reflected by elevated shorelines mapped around Lake Eyre and, to a lesser degree, around the Frome–Gregory system to the southeast of Lake Eyre. Comprehensive research in the Lake Eyre catchment over the last several decades has constrained the ages and elevations of these shoreline deposits, which now enable us to use digital elevation models to map these paleo-lakes. By incrementally filling each lake meter by meter, the areas and volumes of the paleo-lakes are calculated and the paleohydrologic processes, including the flow direction across spillovers, are reconstructed. At the peak 125-ka highstand, Lake Eyre stood at +10 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) and covered nearly 35 000 km2, more than three times the area of the current playa. Together with the Frome–Gregory system, it held 430 km3 of water. By contrast, the deepest historic filling held 30 km3. These lake levels represent climatic conditions very different from the modern situation. Due to discontinuous preservation of the shoreline deposits around the lakes and due to the scale of the lake systems, mapping the former levels of Lake Eyre and the Frome–Gregory system has been impossible prior to the availability of a digital elevation model. Paramatizing the area/volume relationships of water required to fill the lake to varying levels will provide data for quantification of climate and precipitation changes over time.},

abstract = {High-resolution data enabling identification and analysis of the hydrometeorological causative processes of flash floods have been collected and analysed for 25 extreme flash floods (60 drainage basins, ranging in area from 9.5 to 1856km2) across Europe. Most of the selected floods are located in a geographical belt crossing Europe from western Mediterranean (Catalunia and southwestern France) to Black Sea, covering northern Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Slovakia and Romania. Criteria for flood selection were high intensity of triggering rainfall and flood response and availability of high-resolution reliable data. Hydrometeorological data collected and collated for each event were checked by using a hydrological model. The derivation and analysis of summarising variables based on the data archive has made it possible to outline some characteristics of flash floods in various morphoclimatic regions of Europe. Peak discharge data for more than 50{\%} of the studied watersheds derive from post-flood surveys in ungauged streams. This stresses both the significance of post-flood surveys in building and extending flash flood data bases, and the need to develop new methods for flash flood hazard assessment able to take into account data from post-event analysis. Examination of data shows a peculiar seasonality effect on flash flood occurrence, with events in the Mediterranean and Alpine-Mediterranean regions mostly occurring in autumn, whereas events in the inland Continental region commonly occur in summer, revealing different climatic forcing. Consistently with this seasonality effect, spatial extent and duration of the events is generally smaller for the Continental events with respect to those occurring in the Mediterranean region. Furthermore, the flash flood regime is generally more intense in the Mediterranean Region than in the Continental areas. The runoff coefficients of the studied flash floods are usually rather low (mean value: 0.35). Moderate differences in runoff coefficient are observed between the studied climatic regions, with higher values in the Mediterranean region. Antecedent saturation conditions have a significant impact on event runoff coefficients, showing the influence of initial soil moisture status even on extreme flash flood events and stressing the importance of accounting soil moisture for operational flash flood forecasting. The runoff response displays short lag times (mostly {\textless}6h). The identified relations between watershed area, stream length and response time enable determination of a characteristic mean velocity of the flash flood process (at basin scales less than 350km2), defined as the ratio of characteristic length (mean river length) and time (response time or lag time), equal to 3ms-1. This is related to the celerity with which the flood wave moves through the catchment. The analysis of the response time provides information on the time resolution and the spatial density of the networks required for monitoring the storms that generate flash floods. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A neural network is developed to forecast rainfall intensity fields in space and time; it is a three-layer learning network with input, hidden, and output layers. Training is conducted using back propagation where the input and output rainfall fields are presented to the neural network as a series of learning sets. After training is complete, the neural network is used to forecast rainfall intensity fields with a lead time of 1 h using only the current field as input. Rainfall fields are generated using a space-time mathematical rainfall simulation model, and forecasted fields are compared with the perfectly known model-produced fields. Results indicate that a neural network is capable of learning the complex relationship describing the space-time evolution of rainfall such as that inherent in a complex rainfall simulation model. One hour ahead forecasts are produced, and comparisons with true mean areal intensities and percent areal coverage indicate that in most cases the method performs well when applied to the events used in training. The neural network is used to forecast a series of events not included in the training data and is shown to perform well when a relatively large number of hidden nodes are utilized. Performance of the neural network is compared with two other methods of short-term forecasting, persistence and nowcasting.},

@article{Chumchean2006a,
abstract = {A procedure for estimating radar rainfall in real time consists of three main steps: 1) the measurement of reflectivity and removal of known sources of errors, 2) the conversion of the reflectivity to a rainfall rate (Z–R conversion), and 3) the adjustment of the mean field bias as assessed using a rain gauge network. Error correction is associated with the first two steps and incorporates removing erroneous measurements and correcting biases in the Z–R conversion. This paper investigates the relative importance of error correction and the mean field bias–adjustment processes. In addition to the correction for ground clutter, the bright band, and hail, the two error correction strategies considered here are 1) a scale transformation function to remove range-dependent bias in measured reflectivity resulting from an increase in observation volume with range, and 2) the classification of storm types to account for the variation in Z–R relationships for convective and stratiform rainfall. The mean field bias is removed using two alternatives: 1) estimation of the bias at each time step based on the sample of observations available, and 2) use of a Kalman filter to estimate the bias under assumptions of a Markovian dependence structure. A 7-month record of radar and rain gauge rainfall for Sydney, Australia, were used in this study. The results show a stepwise decrease in the root-mean-square error (rmse) of radar rainfall with added levels of error correction using either of the two mean field bias–adjustment methods considered in our study. It was found that although the effects of the two error correction strategies were small compared to bias adjustment, they do form an important step of radar-rainfall estimation.},

abstract = {An event-based regional model for the frequency and magnitude of runoff events in the arid Negev of Israel has been developed. The model considers the number of events in a year, their arrival times, maximum observed discharges and volumes, the distribution of peak discharges and event volumes, and regional relationships between catchment area and magnitudes associated with 10- to 100-year recurrence intervals. The occurrence of events follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters estimated from the mean and the variance of the number of events in a year, which, in turn, are positively correlated with the mean annual depth of precipitation over the catchment. Arrival times of events follow the Pearson type-3 distribution. The enveloping curve of the maximum observed volumes is related to the catchment area by a power function. For catchments smaller than 250 to 300 km2 in area, the discharges and volumes associated with 10- to 100year recurrence intervals are found to be proportional to the catchment area. For large catchments, the discharge-area relationship may yield an inverse trend, and the volume may cease to increase as the area increases. Locations of the turning points for the relationships vary between watersheds.},

abstract = {Radar-based estimates of rainfall rates and accumulations are one of the principal tools used by the National Weather Service (NWS) to identify areas of extreme precipitation that could lead to flooding. Radar-based rainfall estimates have been compared to gauge observations for 13 convective storm events over a densely instrumented, experimental watershed to derive an accurate reflectivity–rainfall rate (i.e., Z–R) relationship for these events. The resultant Z–R relationship, which is much different than the NWS operational Z–R, has been examined for a separate, independent event that occurred over a different location. For all events studied, the NWS operational Z–R significantly overestimates rainfall compared to gauge measurements. The gauge data from the experimental network, the NWS operational rain estimates, and the improved estimates resulting from this study have been input into a hydrologic model to “predict” watershed runoff for an intense event. Rainfall data from the gauges and from the derived Z–R relation produce predictions in relatively good agreement with observed streamflows. The NWS Z–R estimates lead to predicted peak discharge rates that are more than twice as large as the observed discharges. These results were consistent over a relatively wide range of subwatershed areas (4–148 km2). The experimentally derived Z–R relationship may provide more accurate radar estimates for convective storms over the southwest United States than does the operational convective Z–R used by the NWS. These initial results suggest that the generic NWS Z–R relation, used nationally for convective storms, might be substantially improved for regional application.},

Palaeoclimatic and associated flow regime variations are recorded in an archive of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine sediments that are particularly accessible for deposits from the past {\~{}}300ka, and are especially relevant for the past {\~{}}50ka during which humans have inhabited Australia. Due to its great size, economic resources and diverse latitudinal extent, it has for over six decades been the focus of environmental, scientific and resource-based studies across numerous disciplines. With an emphasis on assessing the scientific and environmental research over this period, this paper is divided into four parts: Part A provides an introduction and background. Part B provides the geological history, including evidence of substantial Tertiary and Quaternary climate change. Part C covers the contemporary environmental conditions, and Part D presents a conclusion and summary. This not only represents the first comprehensive review of current knowledge of any of the world's truly large dryland drainage basins, but also highlights how more multi-disciplinary research is required. Key remaining questions revolve around the impact of global weather systems on the LEB; the lake-level story in relation to a more precise picture of Late Quaternary climate change; the role of humans and climate in the demise of the megafauna; modern hydrological changes; the role of vegetation in altering channel morphology and flow efficiencies; and nature of flood transmissions.},

abstract = {Channel Country rivers drain very large basins, have extremely variable annual flows, and experience very high relative flood magnitudes. Regional relationships describe how mean annual discharge, the average number and length of zero-flow periods, and event duration vary as power functions of drainage area. Flood flows (Q2, Q5, Q10, Q20) vary in a more complex way with drainage area, relationships changing from positive to negative because of increased transmission losses in the larger catchments. An event approach based on three distinct types of event—single, multiple, compound—provides an appropriate vehicle for analysing hydrologic variability. Single events have significantly smaller magnitudes, shorter durations and more rapid times-to-peak. Multiple events, although more akin to compound events than single ones overall, tend to occupy a middle ground, behaving more like single events at smaller runoff volumes and in smaller basins but more like compound ones at the other end of the scale. Generally there is a progressive increase in magnitude, duration, time-to-peak and level of unpredictability from single to compound events. Travel time, a more elusive variable to analyse, decreases log-linearly with increasing discharge in upper reaches but varies nonlinearly with discharge further downstream, reaching an intermediate maximum that is equated with the onset of floodplain flow.},

Dry for years, on occasions they carry enormous floods, with annual volumes of 40 km3 and instantaneous discharges of the order of 30,000 m3 s−1. Mean annual runoff of the basin is 4 km3 or 3.5 mm, significantly less than the 57 mm for the whole of Australia. This paper examines Lake Eyre and its drainage basin, describing the historical hydrology of the catchment, both in terms of instrument records and inflows hindcast using a model based on the technique of coral fluorescence palaeohydrological reconstruction. Coral fluorescence is a function of nearby-river discharge, and can be used to reconstruct annual river outputs reconstruction. Coral fluorescence is a function of nearby-river discharge, and can be used to reconstruct annual river outputs beyond the instrument period. The Burdekin River catchment runoff history is strongly paralleled by the volumes of Lake Eyre inflows during the period of common reliable instrument gaugings. The Burdekin runoff data have been extended back to 1735 A.D. using the correlation between river discharge and annual growth-band fluorescence in an old coral from Pandora Reef, off the North Queensland coast. For the instrument period 1952 to 1980, 73{\%} of the variance between coral fluorescence and Burdekin discharge is common. During the period 1949–1980, 41{\%} of the variance between coral fluorescence and Lake Eyre inflow data is common. Modelled inflows to Lake Eyre for the period 1885–1948 are based on the latter data set.},

abstract = {This is the first of two papers that describe the surface hydrology of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) (1,140,000km2) in central Australia and compares some key characteristics with those observed from arid regions globally. This paper concentrates on annual rainfall, whereas the second paper is devoted to streamflow. The first part describes the LEB's climate (arid to semi-arid), which is dominated by a subtropical high pressure ridge stretching latitudinally across central Australia. Then follow major analyses that include the characteristics of rainfall, wet and dry spell lengths and cumulative surpluses and deficiencies, rainfall trends and intra- and inter-decadal fluctuations, and the relationship between rainfall and El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The paper concludes with six conclusions, the key ones being: the variability of the annual rainfall (based on the coefficient of variation) in the LEB is approximately 60{\%} greater than that found for stations located in arid regions in the rest of the world; there is a bias towards longer lengths of dry years than observed in the rest of Australia; and, there is a significant lag correlation between rainfall and ENSO, particularly in the east and in the latter part of a year.},

The streams are unregulated and are characterised by extreme discharge variation. The analyses reported cover only surface hydrology and include comparisons with arid zone catchments globally. The paper discusses spatial runoff and annual streamflow characteristics, flow duration and baseflow index (BFI) analyses, annual flood frequency analysis and flood transmission losses, a water balance study, wet and dry run length analysis and, finally, yield from hypothetical reservoirs located across the LEB. There are 12 conclusions listed at the end of the paper. We identify two highlights as follows:•The coefficient of variation of annual flows, Cv, varies from 0.98 to 2.62. Compared with 45 arid zone rivers world-wide excluding Australian rivers, the annual Cv of the LEB streams are approximately double the average variability found world-wide.•Large transmission losses occur as flood flows move down the middle reaches of the major river systems. The transmission losses vary non-linearly with flood size as a result of differing transmission efficiencies between primary channels and the floodplain, and varying floodplain utilisation.},

abstract = {The available records of inflows to Lake Eyre cover only forty five years. Their quality is questionable. As longer time series of precipitation records are available, the observed series of inflows to Lake Eyre can be extended with the help of a rainfall-runoff model. Further reconstruction of the inflow series can be achieved by examining local evidence or with the help of proxy data. However, the limitations of these extensions and reconstructions of inflows are severe. The inflows to Lake Eyre could be considered one of the most convincing manifestations of hydrological uncertainty. However, it is apparent that major flooding episodes in the Lake Eyre Basin are most often associated with La Ni{\~{n}}a phases of the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The paper presents a hydrological description of the Lake Eyre Basin and large-scale contemporary and palaeo climatic patterns which affect the water balance of the catchment. A simple water balance model has been constructed to determine storages of the lake when annual evaporation reaches equilibrium with annual runoff.},

abstract = {Lake Eyre is the terminal playa in a large closed basin which receives the majority of its moisture from the summer monsoon. Modern Lake Eyre receives intermittent floodings at times of increased monsoon intensity, generally associated with the La Ni{\~{n}}a phase of the ENSO cycle. Lake Eyre was a perennial lake during several phases of increased monsoon activity during the late Quaternary, specifically about 125 ka, 80 ka, 65 ka, and 40 ka [Magee (1997) Late Quaternary Environments and Palaeohydrology of Lake Eyre, Arid Central Australia. Unpubl. Ph.D. Thesis, Australian National University, Canberra]. These lake highstands are reflected by elevated shorelines mapped around Lake Eyre and, to a lesser degree, around the Frome–Gregory system to the southeast of Lake Eyre. Comprehensive research in the Lake Eyre catchment over the last several decades has constrained the ages and elevations of these shoreline deposits, which now enable us to use digital elevation models to map these paleo-lakes. By incrementally filling each lake meter by meter, the areas and volumes of the paleo-lakes are calculated and the paleohydrologic processes, including the flow direction across spillovers, are reconstructed. At the peak 125-ka highstand, Lake Eyre stood at +10 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) and covered nearly 35 000 km2, more than three times the area of the current playa. Together with the Frome–Gregory system, it held 430 km3 of water. By contrast, the deepest historic filling held 30 km3. These lake levels represent climatic conditions very different from the modern situation. Due to discontinuous preservation of the shoreline deposits around the lakes and due to the scale of the lake systems, mapping the former levels of Lake Eyre and the Frome–Gregory system has been impossible prior to the availability of a digital elevation model. Paramatizing the area/volume relationships of water required to fill the lake to varying levels will provide data for quantification of climate and precipitation changes over time.},

abstract = {The Dead Sea (drainage area of ∼42,200 km2) is a terminal lake fed from the north by the Jordan River. The main water source into the Dead Sea is runoff, and its level is highly sensitive to the annual rainfall in the upper Jordan River drainage basin. Here, we summarize relevant data about present and past surface-water hydrology in the drainage basin and water input into the Dead Sea. The lower Jordan River, with a natural mean annual discharge of ∼1100 106 m3 yr−1, drains Mediterranean to semiarid areas in northern Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Additional water is contributed from tributaries such as the Zarqa River (64 106 m3 yr−1). The diversion of water from these and other sources since the 1960s to an inflow of only ∼210 106 m3 yr−1 caused a 20 m decline of the Dead Sea level. The ephemeral Nahal Arava drains hyperarid areas south of the Dead Sea and contributes small volumes of water (∼5 106 m3 yr−1) but experiences occasional large floods (up to 1000 m3 s−1); the smaller, steep ephemeral tributaries west of the Dead Sea produce relatively large floods (up to 775 m3 s−1) due to their wetter headwaters, but their volumes are relatively small ({\textless}3 106m3). The annual inflow (∼200 106m3 yr−1) to the Dead Sea from the eastern, semiarid tributaries is divided between base flows (∼65{\%} of annual discharge) and winter floods. In the arid part of the basin, transmission losses and recharge into the shallow alluvial aquifers and probably also to the deeper aquifers during floods are directly related to flow volume. Transmission losses in Nahal Zin decrease with flood magnitude from ∼86{\%} to 100{\%} in small floods of {\textless}10 m3 s−1 to ∼10{\%} for large floods of up to 1500 m3 s−1. During the largest floods, the volume of these losses can exceed 4 106 m3.$\backslash$nRare paleofloods during the past 2000 yr in the Negev were 2–3 times larger than present-day measured floods. The temporal distribution of paleofloods shows that periods with a high frequency of large floods alternate with periods of few large floods. Periods with a high frequency of large floods correlate with high Dead Sea levels, and a low frequency of floods correlates with low lake levels.},

This helps to reanalyse the frequency of floods in this drainage system. The clusters of floods around 1000 years sp and again during the last 60 years are characterized by high flow magnitudes. Periods with many floods correspond well to periods with high Dead Sea levels and are probably relatively wet periods, while periods with few floods correspond well to low Dead Sea levels indicating a drier climate.

abstract = {The objective of this research is to evaluate daily rain rates derived from three widely used high-resolution satellite precipitation products (PERSIANN, TMPA-3B42V7, and TMPA-3B42RT) using rain gauge observations over the entire country of Iran. Evaluations are implemented for 47 comprehensive daily rainfall events during the winter and spring seasons from 2003 to 2006. These events are selected because each encompasses more than 50{\%} of the country?s area. In this study, daily rainfall observations derived from 1180 rain gauges distributed throughout the country are employed as reference surface data. Six statistical indices: bias, multiplicative bias (MBias), relative bias (RBias), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and linear correlation coefficient (CC), as well as a contingency table are applied to evaluate the satellite rainfall estimates qualitatively. The spatially averaged results over the entire country indicate that 3B42V7, with an average bias value of ?1.47 mmd?1, RBias of ?13.6{\%}, MAE of 4.5 mmd?1, RMSE of 6.5 mmd?1, and CC of 0.61, leads to better estimates of daily precipitation than those of PERSIANN and 3B42RT. Furthermore, PERSIANN with an average MBias value of 0.56 tends to underestimate precipitation, while 3B42V7 and 3B42RT with average MBias values of 0.86 and 1.02, respectively, demonstrate a reasonable agreement in regard to rainfall estimations with the rain gauge data. With respect to the categorical verification technique implemented in this study, PERSIANN exhibits better results associated with the probability of detection of rainfall events; however, its false alarm ratio is worse than that of 3B42V7 and 3B42RT.},

abstract = {Radar-based estimates of rainfall rates and accumulations are one of the principal tools used by the National Weather Service (NWS) to identify areas of extreme precipitation that could lead to flooding. Radar-based rainfall estimates have been compared to gauge observations for 13 convective storm events over a densely instrumented, experimental watershed to derive an accurate reflectivity–rainfall rate (i.e., Z–R) relationship for these events. The resultant Z–R relationship, which is much different than the NWS operational Z–R, has been examined for a separate, independent event that occurred over a different location. For all events studied, the NWS operational Z–R significantly overestimates rainfall compared to gauge measurements. The gauge data from the experimental network, the NWS operational rain estimates, and the improved estimates resulting from this study have been input into a hydrologic model to “predict” watershed runoff for an intense event. Rainfall data from the gauges and from the derived Z–R relation produce predictions in relatively good agreement with observed streamflows. The NWS Z–R estimates lead to predicted peak discharge rates that are more than twice as large as the observed discharges. These results were consistent over a relatively wide range of subwatershed areas (4–148 km2). The experimentally derived Z–R relationship may provide more accurate radar estimates for convective storms over the southwest United States than does the operational convective Z–R used by the NWS. These initial results suggest that the generic NWS Z–R relation, used nationally for convective storms, might be substantially improved for regional application.},

abstract = {The lack of adequate field measurements often hampers the construction and calibration of rainfall‐runoff models over many of the world's watersheds. We adopted methodologies that rely heavily on readily available remote sensing datasets as viable alternatives for assessing, managing, and modelling of such remote and inadequately gauged regions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was selected for continuous (1998–2005) rainfall‐runoff modelling of one such area, the northeast part of the Pishin Lora basin (NEPL). Input to the model included satellite‐based Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation data, and modelled runoff was calibrated against satellite‐based observations, the latter included: (i) monthly estimates of the water volumes impounded by the Khushdil Khan (latitude 30°40′N, longitude 67°40′E), and the Kara Lora (latitude 30°34′N, longitude 66°52′E) reservoirs, and (ii) inferred wet versus dry conditions in streams across the NEPL. Calibrations were also conducted against observed flow reported from the Burj Aziz Khan station at the NEPL outlet (latitude 30°20′N; longitude 66°35′E). Model simulations indicate that (i) average annual precipitation (1998–2005), runoff and recharge in the NEPL are 1300 × 106 m3, 148 × 106 m3, and 361 × 106 m3, respectively; (ii) within the NEPL watershed, precipitation and runoff are high for the northeast (precipitation: 194 mm/year; runoff: 38 × 106 m3/year) and northwest (134 mm/year; 26 × 106 m3/year) basins compared to the southern basin (124 mm/year; 8 × 106 m3/year); and (3) construction of delay action dams in the northeast and northwest basins could increase recharge from 361 × 106 m3/year up to 432 × 106 m3/year and achieve sustainable extraction. The adopted methodologies are not a substitute for traditional approaches, but they could provide first‐order estimates for rainfall, runoff, and recharge in the arid and semi‐arid parts of the world that are inaccessible and/or lack adequate coverage with field data.},

abstract = {Semiarid flash floods pose a significant danger for life and property in many dry regions around the world. One effective way to mitigate flood risk lies in implementing a real-time forecast and warning system based on a rainfall-runoff model. This study used a semiarid, physics-based, and spatially distributed watershed model driven by high-resolution radar rainfall input to evaluate such a system. The predictive utility of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for several runoff events within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for different events and that real-time parameter updating may be preferable.},

The obtained Z(e)-R relations are curved$\backslash$nlines in log-log space and therefore may better represent the$\backslash$ntransformation of Z(e) into R than any straight-line power law.$\backslash$nThe WPMM also performs significantly better for rainfall integrations$\backslash$nthan power law. The standard deviation of the WPMM rainfall integration,$\backslash$nafter correction for systematic bias errors, is only two-thirds that of$\backslash$nthe standard deviation obtained when using a power law based on$\backslash$ndisdrometer measured drop size distribution.$\backslash$nAdditional improvement in the accuracy of the WPMM is provided upon its$\backslash$napplication to data that has been objectively classified into different$\backslash$nrain regimes, which is the topic of another related study in this$\backslash$njournal.},

Because of the strong spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, estimation of spatially distributed rain rates is challenging. Despite the fact that weather radars provide high-resolution (but indirect) observations of precipitation, they are not used in hydrological applications as extensively as one could expect. The goal of the present review paper is to investigate this question and to provide a clear view of the opportunities (e.g., for flash floods, urban hydrology, rainfall spatial extremes) the limitations (e.g., complicated error structure, need for adjustment) and the challenges for the use of weather radar in hydrology (i.e., validation studies, precipitation forecasting, mountainous precipitation, error propagation in hydrological models). ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Radar-based estimates of rainfall rates and accumulations are one of the principal tools used by the National Weather Service (NWS) to identify areas of extreme precipitation that could lead to flooding. Radar-based rainfall estimates have been compared to gauge observations for 13 convective storm events over a densely instrumented, experimental watershed to derive an accurate reflectivity–rainfall rate (i.e., Z–R) relationship for these events. The resultant Z–R relationship, which is much different than the NWS operational Z–R, has been examined for a separate, independent event that occurred over a different location. For all events studied, the NWS operational Z–R significantly overestimates rainfall compared to gauge measurements. The gauge data from the experimental network, the NWS operational rain estimates, and the improved estimates resulting from this study have been input into a hydrologic model to “predict” watershed runoff for an intense event. Rainfall data from the gauges and from the derived Z–R relation produce predictions in relatively good agreement with observed streamflows. The NWS Z–R estimates lead to predicted peak discharge rates that are more than twice as large as the observed discharges. These results were consistent over a relatively wide range of subwatershed areas (4–148 km2). The experimentally derived Z–R relationship may provide more accurate radar estimates for convective storms over the southwest United States than does the operational convective Z–R used by the NWS. These initial results suggest that the generic NWS Z–R relation, used nationally for convective storms, might be substantially improved for regional application.},

Major floods occurred along 500km of the Paroo River in March 2010 at levels unequaled since 2000. Dual polarization (HH/HV) L-Band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was obtained from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) to evaluate its use for mapping flooding over an area of high conservation value floodplain wetlands. The data were shown to be highly informative for mapping flooded classes and provide an alternative data source to optical imagery in the presence of cloud cover. Due to radar speckle, segmentation was used to partition the scenes within eCognition Developer. Classification was performed on image objects using decision rules based on field verified radar backscatter thresholds of classes and change detection. The methods developed for single and multiple images provide a framework for operational mapping and monitoring water over time, as well as a rapid response strategy for flood emergencies.

abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates DryMOD, a dynamic water balance model of the key hydrological process in drylands that is based on free, public-domain datasets. The rainfall model of DryMOD makes optimal use of spatially disaggregated Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets to simulate hourly rainfall intensities at a spatial resolution of 1-km. Regional-scale applications of the model in seasonal catchments in Tunisia and Senegal characterize runoff and soil moisture distribution and dynamics in response to varying rainfall data inputs and soil properties. The results highlight the need for hourly-based rainfall simulation and for correcting TRMM 3B42 rainfall intensities for the fractional cover of rainfall (FCR). Without FCR correction and disaggregation to 1 km, TRMM 3B42 based rainfall intensities are too low to generate surface runoff and to induce substantial changes to soil moisture storage. The outcomes from the sensitivity analysis show that topsoil porosity is the most important soil property for simulation of runoff and soil moisture. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of hydrological investigations at a scale, for which reliable information on soil profile characteristics exists and which is sufficiently fine to account for the heterogeneities of these. Where such information is available, application of DryMOD can assist in the spatial and temporal planning of water harvesting according to runoff-generating areas and the runoff ratio, as well as in the optimization of agricultural activities based on realistic representation of soil moisture conditions.},

abstract = {The rain gauge network associated with the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in southeastern Arizona provides a unique opportunity for direct comparisons of in situ measurements and satellite-based instantaneous rain rate estimates like those from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR). The WGEW network is the densest rain gauge network in the PR coverage area for watersheds greater than 10 km2. It consists of 88 weighing rain gauges within a 149-km2 area. On average, approximately 10 gauges can be found in each PR field of view ({\~{}}5-km diameter). All gauges are very well synchronized with 1-min reporting intervals. This allows generating very-high-temporal-resolution rain rate fields and obtaining accurate estimates of the area-average rain rate for the entire watershed and for a single PR field of view. In this study, instantaneous rain rate fields from the PR and the spatially interpolated gauge measurements (on a 100 m × 100 m grid, updated every 1 min) are compared for all TRMM overpasses in which the PR recorded rain within the WGEW boundaries (25 overpasses during 1999-2010). The results indicate very good agreement between the fields with low bias values (10{\%}) and high correlation coefficients, especially for the near-nadir cases ({\textgreater}0.9). The correlation is high at overpass time but the peak occurs several minutes after the overpass, which can be explained by the fact that it takes several minutes for the raindrops to reach the gauge from the time they are observed by the PR. The correlation improves with the new version of the TRMM algorithm (V7). The study includes assessment of the accuracy of the reference products.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Meteorological radar is a remote sensing system that provides rainfall estimations at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The radar-based rainfall intensities (R) are calculated from the observed radar reflectivities (Z). Often, rain gauge rainfall observations are used in combination with the radar data to find the optimal parameters in the Z–R transformation equation. The scale dependency of the power-law Z–R parameters when estimated from radar reflectivity and rain gauge intensity data is explored herein. The multiplicative (a) and exponent (b) parameters are said to be “scale dependent” if applying the observed and calculated rainfall intensities to objective function at different scale results in different “optimal” parameters. Radar and gauge data were analyzed from convective storms over a midsize, semiarid, and well-equipped watershed. Using the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) objective function, a significant scale dependency was observed. Increased time- and space scales resulted in a considerable increase of the a parameter and decrease of the b parameter. Two sources of uncertainties related to scale dependency were examined: 1) observational uncertainties, which were studied both experimentally and with simplified models that allow representation of observation errors; and 2) model uncertainties. It was found that observational errors are mainly (but not only) associated with positive bias of the b parameter that is reduced with integration, at least for small scales. Model errors also result in scale dependency, but the trend is less systematic, as in the case of observational errors. It is concluded that identification of optimal scale for Z–R relationship determination requires further knowledge of reflectivity and rain-intensity error structure.},

The bias is minimized in June–July–August and September–October–November. Bias is generally high for all algorithms in the dry seasons when rainfall is minimal but is less pronounced in the dry seasons of southern African climatic regions. In general, 3B43 has the closest agreement with rain gauge data. The derived standard errors of the algorithms in the climatic regions of Africa are used as a measure of reliability and show that quantitative climatological estimates of TRMM PR are reliable only in the wettest season of the northern savanna and southern semiarid regions when the mean precipitation is greater than 120 mm month?1 .

abstract = {The spaceborne weather radar onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite can be used to adjust Ground-based Radar (GR) echoes, as a function of the range from the GR site. The adjustment is based on the average linear radar reflectivity in circular rings around the GR site, for both the GR and attenuation-corrected . NearSurfZ TRMM Precipitation Radar (TPR) images. In previous studies, it was found that in winter, for the lowest elevation of the Cyprus C-band radar, the GR/TPR equivalent rain rate ratio was decreasing, on average, of approximately 8. dB per decade. In this paper, the same analysis has been applied to another C-band radar in the southeastern Mediterranean area. For the lowest elevation of the "Shacham" radar in Israel, the GR/TPR equivalent rain rate ratio is found to decrease of approximately 6. dB per decade. The average departure at the "reference", intermediate range is related to the calibration of the GR. The negative slope of the range dependence is considered to be mainly caused by an overshooting problem (increasing sampling volume of the GR with range combined with non-homogeneous beam filling and, on average, a decreasing vertical profile of radar reflectivity). To check this hypothesis, we have compared the same . NearSurfZ TPR images versus GR data acquired using the second elevation. We expected these data to be affected more by overshooting, especially at distant ranges: the negative slope of the range dependence was in fact found to be more evident than in the case of the lowest GR elevation for both the Cypriot and Israeli radar. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to evaluate daily rain rates derived from three widely used high-resolution satellite precipitation products (PERSIANN, TMPA-3B42V7, and TMPA-3B42RT) using rain gauge observations over the entire country of Iran. Evaluations are implemented for 47 comprehensive daily rainfall events during the winter and spring seasons from 2003 to 2006. These events are selected because each encompasses more than 50{\%} of the country?s area. In this study, daily rainfall observations derived from 1180 rain gauges distributed throughout the country are employed as reference surface data. Six statistical indices: bias, multiplicative bias (MBias), relative bias (RBias), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and linear correlation coefficient (CC), as well as a contingency table are applied to evaluate the satellite rainfall estimates qualitatively. The spatially averaged results over the entire country indicate that 3B42V7, with an average bias value of ?1.47 mmd?1, RBias of ?13.6{\%}, MAE of 4.5 mmd?1, RMSE of 6.5 mmd?1, and CC of 0.61, leads to better estimates of daily precipitation than those of PERSIANN and 3B42RT. Furthermore, PERSIANN with an average MBias value of 0.56 tends to underestimate precipitation, while 3B42V7 and 3B42RT with average MBias values of 0.86 and 1.02, respectively, demonstrate a reasonable agreement in regard to rainfall estimations with the rain gauge data. With respect to the categorical verification technique implemented in this study, PERSIANN exhibits better results associated with the probability of detection of rainfall events; however, its false alarm ratio is worse than that of 3B42V7 and 3B42RT.},

Zonal mean analysis shows that TRMM PR has a large overestimation in the tropical-rain-forest region of Africa in December–January–February and in March–April–May. The bias is minimized in June–July–August and September–October–November. Bias is generally high for all algorithms in the dry seasons when rainfall is minimal but is less pronounced in the dry seasons of southern African climatic regions. In general, 3B43 has the closest agreement with rain gauge data. The derived standard errors of the algorithms in the climatic regions of Africa are used as a measure of reliability and show that quantitative climatological estimates of TRMM PR are reliable only in the wettest season of the northern savanna and southern semiarid regions when the mean precipitation is greater than 120 mm month?1 . The study also shows that TRMM PR has the closest agreement with 3B43 over the South Atlantic Ocean. Over land, all the satellite estimates showed significant seasonally and regionally dependent bias.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates DryMOD, a dynamic water balance model of the key hydrological process in drylands that is based on free, public-domain datasets. The rainfall model of DryMOD makes optimal use of spatially disaggregated Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets to simulate hourly rainfall intensities at a spatial resolution of 1-km. Regional-scale applications of the model in seasonal catchments in Tunisia and Senegal characterize runoff and soil moisture distribution and dynamics in response to varying rainfall data inputs and soil properties. The results highlight the need for hourly-based rainfall simulation and for correcting TRMM 3B42 rainfall intensities for the fractional cover of rainfall (FCR). Without FCR correction and disaggregation to 1 km, TRMM 3B42 based rainfall intensities are too low to generate surface runoff and to induce substantial changes to soil moisture storage. The outcomes from the sensitivity analysis show that topsoil porosity is the most important soil property for simulation of runoff and soil moisture. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of hydrological investigations at a scale, for which reliable information on soil profile characteristics exists and which is sufficiently fine to account for the heterogeneities of these. Where such information is available, application of DryMOD can assist in the spatial and temporal planning of water harvesting according to runoff-generating areas and the runoff ratio, as well as in the optimization of agricultural activities based on realistic representation of soil moisture conditions.},

abstract = {Simultaneous observations made with optical- and impact-type disdrometers were analyzed to broaden knowledge of these instruments. These observations were designed to test how accurately they measure drop size distributions (DSDs). The instruments' use in determining radar rainfall relations such as that between reflectivity and rainfall rate also was analyzed. A unique set of instruments, including two video and one Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer along with eight tipping-bucket rain gauges, was operated within a small area of about 100 × 50 m2 during a 2-month-long field campaign in central Florida. The disdrometers were evaluated by comparing their rain totals with the rain gauges. Both disdrometers underestimated the rain totals, but the video disdrometers had higher readings, resulting in a better agreement with the gauges. The disdrometers underreported small- to medium-size drops, which most likely caused the underestimation of rain totals. However, more medium-size drops were measured by the video disdrometer, thus producing higher rain rates for that instrument. The comparison of DSDs, averaged at different timescales, showed good agreement between the two types of disdrometers. A continuous increase in the number of drops toward smaller sizes was only evident in the video disdrometers at rain rates above 20 mm h−1. Otherwise, the concentration of small drops remained the same or decreased to the smallest measurable size. The Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer severely underestimated only at very small drop size (diameter ≤ 0.5 mm). Beyond the Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer measurement limit were very large drops that fell during heavy and extreme rain intensities. The derived parameters of exponential and gamma distributions reflect the good agreement between the disdrometers' DSD measurements. The parameters of fitted distributions were close to each other, especially when all the coincident measurements were averaged. The low concentrations of very large drops observed by the video disdrometers did not have a significant impact on reflectivity measurements in terms of the relationships between reflectivity and other integral parameters (rain rate, liquid water content, and attenuation). There was almost no instrument dependency. Rather, the relations depend on the method of regression and the choice of independent variable. Also, relationships derived for S-band radars and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) differ from each other primarily because of the higher reflectivities at the shorter PR wavelength at high rain-rate regime.},

The WGEW network is the densest rain gauge network in the PR coverage area for watersheds greater than 10 km2. It consists of 88 weighing rain gauges within a 149-km2 area. On average, approximately 10 gauges can be found in each PR field of view ({\~{}}5-km diameter). All gauges are very well synchronized with 1-min reporting intervals. This allows generating very-high-temporal-resolution rain rate fields and obtaining accurate estimates of the area-average rain rate for the entire watershed and for a single PR field of view. In this study, instantaneous rain rate fields from the PR and the spatially interpolated gauge measurements (on a 100 m × 100 m grid, updated every 1 min) are compared for all TRMM overpasses in which the PR recorded rain within the WGEW boundaries (25 overpasses during 1999-2010). The results indicate very good agreement between the fields with low bias values (10{\%}) and high correlation coefficients, especially for the near-nadir cases ({\textgreater}0.9). The correlation is high at overpass time but the peak occurs several minutes after the overpass, which can be explained by the fact that it takes several minutes for the raindrops to reach the gauge from the time they are observed by the PR. The correlation improves with the new version of the TRMM algorithm (V7). The study includes assessment of the accuracy of the reference products.$\backslash$n},

Rainfall fields are generated using a space-time mathematical rainfall simulation model, and forecasted fields are compared with the perfectly known model-produced fields. Results indicate that a neural network is capable of learning the complex relationship describing the space-time evolution of rainfall such as that inherent in a complex rainfall simulation model. One hour ahead forecasts are produced, and comparisons with true mean areal intensities and percent areal coverage indicate that in most cases the method performs well when applied to the events used in training. The neural network is used to forecast a series of events not included in the training data and is shown to perform well when a relatively large number of hidden nodes are utilized.

abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region can be considered as the most water-scarce region of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects strong changes in climate across MENA, further exacerbating pressure on available water resources. The objective of this study is to undertake a climate change assessment for 22 MENA countries in order to quantify the problems these countries may encounter up to 2050. To evaluate climate change in MENA, nine global circulation models representing two future periods (2020-2030 and 2040-2050) were statistically downscaled and compared with a current climate, defined as the period 2000-2009. Besides precipitation only this study also focuses on change in water demand by vegetation reference evapotranspiration (ETref). It was found that for both future periods the annual precipitation sum will decrease for the majority of countries, with decreases of 15-20{\%} for the latter period. For some countries, e.g. Djibouti and Yemen, an increase in annual precipitation of 15-20{\%} was found. The annual ETref shows an increase for all countries for both future periods, with the strongest increases for the latter period. For the extreme situation, it was found that the minimum monthly and annual precipitation sum does not become smaller in the future climate. It in fact increases. In contrast, the maximum monthly and annual ETref increases for all countries. This indicates that projected changes in demand are likely to have a more adverse effect than changes in supply. Spatial analysis showed that the largest precipitation decreases are to be found in southern Egypt, Morocco, central and coastal Algeria, Tunisia, central Libya, Syria, and central and eastern Iran. A case study for Morocco revealed that the potential water deficit, which is already apparent for the current climate, becomes even larger for the future climate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Dual polarization (HH/HV) L-Band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was obtained from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) to evaluate its use for mapping flooding over an area of high conservation value floodplain wetlands. The data were shown to be highly informative for mapping flooded classes and provide an alternative data source to optical imagery in the presence of cloud cover. Due to radar speckle, segmentation was used to partition the scenes within eCognition Developer. Classification was performed on image objects using decision rules based on field verified radar backscatter thresholds of classes and change detection. The methods developed for single and multiple images provide a framework for operational mapping and monitoring water over time, as well as a rapid response strategy for flood emergencies.

The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive literature review of the principal sources of error affecting single polarization radar-based rainfall estimates. These include radar miscalibration, attenuation, ground clutter and anomalous propagation, beam blockage, variability of the Z–R relation, range degradation, vertical variability of the precipitation system, vertical air motion and precipitation drift, and temporal sampling errors.

abstract = {While intense scientific efforts have focused on radar precipitation estimation in temperate climatic regimes, relatively few studies have examined dry climatic regions. This paper examines rain depth estimation for a 19 day rainfall period in Israel, where the gauge spatial distribution is particularly nonhomogeneous. This fact exacerbates the main drawback of rain gauge observations, which is undersampling. Meteorological ground-based radar (GR) can supplement the desired information on precipitation distribution. However, especially in a complex orographic region, radar scientists are faced with beam broadening with distance, nonhomogeneous beam filling, and partial-beam occultation, together with changes in the vertical reflectivity profile. This paper presents an improvement of GR precipitation estimates thanks to a range adjustment based on spaceborne meteorological radar. In the past, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite radar was used for checking the GR mean field bias around the world. To our knowledge, however, it is the first time that GR-derived cumulative rainfall amounts show a better agreement with gauges, thanks to the mean field bias and range-dependent compensation derived using the well-calibrated Ku band TRMM radar as a reference. The average bias improves from +1.0 dB to -0.3 dB; more interesting and difficult to obtain is a reduction of the dispersion of the error. Using TRMM-based range compensation, the scatter decreases from 2.21 dB to 1.93 dB. We conclude that it is well worth trying to compensate for the GR range degradation.},

A lesser percentage of large, stronger features contributes most of the region's rainfall. Dividing the features into categories based on the median values of volumetric rainfall and maximum height of the 30-dBZ echo is a useful way to visualize the population of features, and the categories selected reflect the life cycle of monsoonal convection.

abstract = {The WSR-88D Precipitation Processing Subsystem (PPS) represents the first attempt at network-wide operational radar-estimated precipitation in the United States. The system brings a dramatic advancement to operational flood forecasting when compared to earlier radars and rain gage networks. Nevertheless, the system suffers from significant limitations inherent to the use of radar to estimate precipitation. These limitations have persisted despite nearly fifty years of research in the field. Much of the problem has been ascribed to the complex nonlinear relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate at the surface. This relationship has been expressed empirically ("Z-R" power law) and many different ones have resulted from various experiments. Following suit, the WSR-88D software allows a change to the Z-R relationship for differing precipitation situations. A review of recent literature, however, reveals that the choice of an appropriate Z-R relationship is not the dominant issue in radar precipitation estimation, as was once widely believed. There are many precipitation estimation errors from radar, and they can often be larger than Z-R irrepresentativeness. These errors are briefly explored as they relate to the WSR-88D. It appears that overshooting of precipitation by the radar beam often produces the largest errors, usually causing precipitation underestimation. This is especially so at long ranges ({\textgreater} 60 nm), but can also occur at short ranges ({\textless} 30 nm) because of the beam elevations used by the PPS. Overshoot is more pronounced in the cool season. Inadequate calibration of WSR-88D network radars also appears to contribute large errors. Potential remedies for the major errors are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability to the WSR-88D. Recommendations for implementation or further study are made based on this applicability.},

In this study, instantaneous rain rate fields from the PR and the spatially interpolated gauge measurements (on a 100 m × 100 m grid, updated every 1 min) are compared for all TRMM overpasses in which the PR recorded rain within the WGEW boundaries (25 overpasses during 1999-2010). The results indicate very good agreement between the fields with low bias values (10{\%}) and high correlation coefficients, especially for the near-nadir cases ({\textgreater}0.9). The correlation is high at overpass time but the peak occurs several minutes after the overpass, which can be explained by the fact that it takes several minutes for the raindrops to reach the gauge from the time they are observed by the PR. The correlation improves with the new version of the TRMM algorithm (V7). The study includes assessment of the accuracy of the reference products.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The monitoring of the world's climate using conventional means is well established, incorporating numerous historical data sets to ensure a long-term record. Parameters such as temperature have been quite accurately recorded over the last 200 years or so, but other parameters such as rainfall are less well recorded. This paper introduces satellite rainfall climatology and why it is important, not only from the longer term study of rainfall, but also for the future monitoring and estimation of rainfall. A summary of the range of satellites and their instruments is reviewed to provide a background to the techniques. These are discussed and their relative merits explored. Finally, examples of the techniques are shown, illustrating the applications to which the satellite-derived data sets may be put. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Royal Meteorological Society},

@article{Rasmussen2013a,
abstract = {Deep convective storms in subtropical South America are some of the most intense in the world, and the hydrological cycle plays an important role in both tropical and subtropical South America. Recent studies have suggested that the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar algorithm significantly underestimates surface rainfall in deep convection over land. This study investigates the range of the rain bias in storms containing four different types of extreme radar echoes: deep convective cores, deep and wide convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions over South America. Storms with deep convective cores show the greatest underestimation, and the bias is unrelated to their echo top height. The bias in wide convective cores relates to the echo top, indicating that storms with significant mixed phase and ice hydrometeors are similarly affected by assumptions in the TRMM algorithm. The relationship between storm type and rain bias remains similar in both subtropical and tropical regions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates DryMOD, a dynamic water balance model of the key hydrological process in drylands that is based on free, public-domain datasets. The rainfall model of DryMOD makes optimal use of spatially disaggregated Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets to simulate hourly rainfall intensities at a spatial resolution of 1-km. Regional-scale applications of the model in seasonal catchments in Tunisia and Senegal characterize runoff and soil moisture distribution and dynamics in response to varying rainfall data inputs and soil properties. The results highlight the need for hourly-based rainfall simulation and for correcting TRMM 3B42 rainfall intensities for the fractional cover of rainfall (FCR). Without FCR correction and disaggregation to 1 km, TRMM 3B42 based rainfall intensities are too low to generate surface runoff and to induce substantial changes to soil moisture storage. The outcomes from the sensitivity analysis show that topsoil porosity is the most important soil property for simulation of runoff and soil moisture. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of hydrological investigations at a scale, for which reliable information on soil profile characteristics exists and which is sufficiently fine to account for the heterogeneities of these. Where such information is available, application of DryMOD can assist in the spatial and temporal planning of water harvesting according to runoff-generating areas and the runoff ratio, as well as in the optimization of agricultural activities based on realistic representation of soil moisture conditions.},

No value has been obtained for the constant of proportionality. Correlation of Z with, rainfall intensity R (both at ground level) on logarithmic scales shows that, within a factor of about two, Z $\alpha$ R2. Vertical scans of rain storms by radar indicate that variation of rain content with height is moderate and accountable. It may be possible therefore to determine with useful accuracy the intensity of rainfall at a point quite distant (say 100 km) by the radar echo from that point.},
